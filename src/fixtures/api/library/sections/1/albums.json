The former brought the producer to the mainstream, while the latter was successful as well -- if not blockbuster level. Issued in some European territories and exported to the U.S., the package is a straightforward two-for-one set, with nothing fancy -- just the albums, straight up, as they were originally released, with two jewel cases within a thin cardboard sleeve. Among the charted singles of the two albums are \"Honey,\" \"Porcelain,\" \"Natural Blues,\" \"Bodyrock,\" \"We Are All Made of Stars,\" \"In This World,\" and \"Extreme Ways.\" ~ Andy Kellman",

        "summary": "Following in the footsteps of Justin Bieber and Soulja Boy, Croatian cellists Luka Sulic and Stjepan Hauser, aka 2Cellos, were discovered through YouTube, after six million people viewed their classical cover version of Michael Jackson's \"Smooth Criminal.\" Now with a major-label deal under their belt, the classically trained musicians face the tough prospect of translating what could be seen a one-trick pony novelty into a full-length album. It's a task made even more difficult considering that, unlike violinist David Garrett's forays into classical rock, which add layers of orchestral production on top of his virtuoso skills, the two 24-year-olds' self-titled debut doesn't feature any other instruments. Luckily, the pair's masterful talents, which seem to produce sounds from a cello that otherwise wouldn't seem possible, more than make up for the lack of background support. Indeed, other than the deliberately sparse reworkings of Johnny Cash's rendition of \"Hurt\" and second Jackson interpretation \"Human Nature,\" its 12 tracks very rarely feel as stripped-back as one might expect, as the duo replicates the twanging guitar hook from Dick Dale's Pulp Fiction theme \"Misirlou,\" the crunching riffs of Nirvana's grunge classic \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" and the lilting piano chords of Muse's \"The Resistance,\" using a combination of plucking, bowing, and frantic strumming. While the bombastic treatments of \"Smooth Criminal\" and Guns N' Roses' \"Welcome to the Jungle\" have received all the attention, the whole concept is just as effective on the slower numbers, as they turn Sting's flamenco-tinged \"Fragile\" into a mournful Gypsy folk ballad and transform U2's \"With Or Without You\" into a poignant instrumental suitable for a soundtrack to a Jane Austen adaptation. The ambitious project only really falters on the one track, which on paper seems best suited to their craft, with their adaptation of \"Viva la Vida\" sounding surprisingly flat when compared to Coldplay's already string-soaked original. But 2Cellos is far from the classical karaoke affair one might have anticipated, as Sulic and Hauser have created an inventive first offering, with unique and innovative arrangements, that deserves to transcend their YouTube beginnings. ~ Jon O'Brien",

        "summary": "Is Blind Pilot a folk outfit playing indie rock or indie rockers playing folk music? Singer/guitarist Israel Nebeker and drummer Ryan Dobrowski operate out of an acoustic setting but their mellow yet hooky tunes have more in common with indie rock outfits than folky troubadours. This Portland, OR-based group winds up being something like Beck or the Shins doing easygoing folksy tunes or Iron & Wine with a poppier sensibility. Whatever genre equation you want to use to describe them, it's easy to say that Blind Pilot have come up with a winning music plan. The opening tune \"Oviedo\" sets the course that they chart throughout the debut full-length. Against some laid-back guitar strumming and gentle drumming, Nebeker warmly sings his hazy but quirky lyrics, which seem like private language of personal confessions (\"Four times is once too much for luck and that's how many times the clock struck/I wandered home saying your name\"). As the song easies along, the arrangement gets fleshed out with muted horns and banjo picking. Nebeker nicely doubles his voice at times, but his singing maintains his intimate, hushed tones. In \"Paint or Pollen,\" he builds a set of beguiling images (\"Milk in your water, black in your primer, wood in your brush\") to express that \"the best is upon us.\" While having an interesting way with words, Nebeker isn't one for direct sentiment. He is a bit more overt in his affection on the title track, where he sings \"My eyes were dark 'till you woke me.\" While \"The Bitter End\" deals with death, it doesn't dip heavily in morbidity as Nebeker expresses his emotions through personal but semi-obscure references to \"hounds-tooth coats and vitamins.\" For all of its off-the-cuff musical vibe, Blind Pilot also exhibits a fine sense of craftsmanship. The vibraphone that weaves through \"One Red Thread\" subtly expands the song's sonic landscape while subdued horns show up again to bolster the woozy melody in \"I Buried a Bone.\" \"Two Towns from Me,\" meanwhile, feels like an indie pop tune performed at half-speed but works wonderfully in its own right. 3 Rounds and a Sound is one of those discs where the whole is greater than its parts. They may not be creating something wildly innovative, but Nebeker, Dobrowski, and their crew, in their own low-key way, have fashioned an impressive amalgam of rustic folk-pop and indie rock. They definitely have Blind Pilot headed in the right direction. ~ Michael Berick",

Pianist Mike Westbrook and his English avant-garde octet remade the Beatles' entire Abbey Road record with unusual interpretations of each of the titles. The instrumental segments work best (Peter Whyman and Alan Wakeman are fine on reeds) but the overly pompous vocals of Phil Minton and Kate Westbrook, which lack the Beatles' humor, largely sink this strange outing. An interesting idea but the results are uncomfortable and not too appealing. ~ Scott Yanow",

        "summary": "The San Francisco Bay Area rock scene of the late '60s was one that encouraged radical experimentation and discouraged the type of mindless conformity that's often plagued corporate rock. When one considers just how different Santana, Jefferson Airplane, Moby Grape, and the Grateful Dead sounded, it becomes obvious just how much it was encouraged. In the mid-'90s, an album as eclectic as Abraxas would be considered a marketing exec's worst nightmare. But at the dawn of the 1970s, this unorthodox mix of rock, jazz, salsa, and blues proved quite successful. Whether adding rock elements to salsa king Tito Puente's \"Oye Como Va,\" embracing instrumental jazz-rock on \"Incident at Neshabur\" and \"Samba Pa Ti,\" or tackling moody blues-rock on Fleetwood Mac's \"Black Magic Woman,\" the band keeps things unpredictable yet cohesive. Many of the Santana albums that came out in the '70s are worth acquiring, but for novices, Abraxas is an excellent place to start. [Columbia/Legacy's 1998 reissue of Abraxas featured three previously unreleased tracks -- \"Se a Cabo,\" \"Toussaint l'Overture,\" \"Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen\" -- which were all recorded live at the Royal Albert Hall on April 18, 1970.] ~ Alex Henderson",

With Absolution, however, the group proves that it's much more than the sum of its influences, delivering a work that revels in the enormity of its ambition, the breadth of its sonic palette, and the intensity of its emotional resonance. Employing a daring mix of classical-influenced piano and strings, metallic guitars, unabashedly strident house-style synths, and the type of production bombast usually reserved for Queen or ELO, Muse often sound like an otherworldly jam session between Rufus Wainwright, the Move, and Evanescence. Packed with both pop hooks and unusual instrumental textures, Absolution invites listeners to expect the unexpected. ~ Pemberton Roach",

        "summary": "At times, Broken Bells' self-titled debut was so hazy that it felt like it was about to dissipate in a cloud of wry West Coast melancholy, but on After the Disco, James Mercer and Brian Burton give that atmosphere a little more form. Building on previous highlights like \"The Ghost Inside\" and \"The High Road,\" the pair dive deeper into their synth pop, new wave, and disco fascinations to soundtrack songs that, as the album title suggests, are filled with comedowns and disappointments. Former single and standout track \"Holding on for Life\" uses its slow-motion disco beat and eerie keyboards to underscore the emptiness lurking in lyrics like \"what a lovely day to be lonely,\" cultivating a mood that falls somewhere between desperate and glamorous. As always in Broken Bells' world, there's a fine line between bittersweet and bummed out; while these aren't the easiest moods to make appealing, Burton and Mercer succeed when they bring some energy to the proceedings. \"Medicine\" bolsters its contemplative sighs with spiky, percussive pop that recalls Gotye, while \"No Matter What You're Told\" gives some brassy bite to its blasÃ© cynicism. Here and on songs like \"Lazy Wonderland,\" which sells the merits of watching the wheels go round and round with some alluring major-minor chord changes, After the Disco feels like a much more organic and satisfying blend of Mercer and Burton's respective strengths than Broken Bells did. However, the duo still sometimes border on being too tasteful, and much of the album's pleasure comes from appreciating flourishes like the flute-like keys on \"Leave It Alone\" and the update of smoky '70s soft rock on \"The Angel and the Fool\" rather than the songs' actual sentiments; even the title of the closing track, \"The Remains of Rock & Roll,\" suggests that passion doesn't have much of a place here. Given Burton and Mercer's pedigrees, it's hard not to want more from Broken Bells, but After the Disco's strongest moments suggest that their music is coming into focus. [After the Disco was also released with a bonus track.] ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "In the 15 months between the release of Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere and After the Gold Rush, Neil Young issued a series of recordings in different styles that could have prepared his listeners for the differences between the two LPs. His two compositions on the Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album DÃ©jÃ  Vu, \"Helpless\" and \"Country Girl,\" returned him to the folk and country styles he had pursued before delving into the hard rock of Everybody Knows; two other singles, \"Sugar Mountain\" and \"Oh, Lonesome Me,\" also emphasized those roots. But \"Ohio,\" a CSNY single, rocked as hard as anything on the second album. After the Gold Rush was recorded with the aid of Nils Lofgren, a 17-year-old unknown whose piano was a major instrument, turning one of the few real rockers, \"Southern Man\" (which had unsparing protest lyrics typical of Phil Ochs), into a more stately effort than anything on the previous album and giving a classic tone to the title track, a mystical ballad that featured some of Young's most imaginative lyrics and became one of his most memorable songs. But much of After the Gold Rush consisted of country-folk love songs, which consolidated the audience Young had earned through his tours and recordings with CSNY; its dark yet hopeful tone matched the tenor of the times in 1970, making it one of the definitive singer/songwriter albums, and it has remained among Young's major achievements. ~ William Ruhlmann",

        "summary": "\"I Melt with You\" will forever be the one specific moment that's Modern English's place in pop history, but the album it came from, After the Snow, isn't anything to sneeze at either. Indeed, in transforming from the quite fine but dour young miserabilists on Mesh & Lace to a brighter incarnation who still had a melancholy side, the quintet found exactly the right combination best-suited for their abilities. Like contemporaries B-Movie and the Sound, Modern English used punk and post-punk roots as a chance to introduce a haunting, beautiful take on romance and emotion, while the contributions of Stephen Walker on keyboard helped make the album both of its time and timeless. That said, the secret weapon on the album is the rhythm section of Michael Conroy and Richard Brown, able to shift from the polite but relentless tribal beat clatter on the excellent \"Life in the Gladhouse\" to the ever more intense punch of the title track, the album's unheralded masterpiece. None of this is to denigrate the contributions of singer Robbie Grey and guitarist Gary McDowell. The former's seemingly mannered singing actually shows a remarkable fluidity at points -- \"After the Snow\" again is a good reference point, as is the fraught, slow-burn epic \"Dawn Chorus\" -- while McDowell works around the band's various arrangements instead of trying to dominate them. Some songs, like \"Face of Wood,\" even find Modern English -- often dogged with Joy Division comparisons early on -- predicting where New Order would go before that band got there itself. Still, \"I Melt with You\" is the main reason most will want to investigate further. A perfect pop moment that didn't have to strain for it, its balance of giddy sentiment and heartfelt passion matched with a rush of acoustic and electric guitar overdubs just can't be beat. ~ Ned Raggett",

        "summary": "The Rolling Stones finally delivered a set of all-original material with Aftermath, which also did much to define the group as the bad boys of rock & roll, with their sneering attitude toward the world in general and the female sex in particular. The borderline misogyny could get a bit juvenile in tunes like \"Stupid Girl.\" But on the other hand the group began incorporating the influences of psychedelia and Dylan into their material with classics like \"Paint It, Black,\" an eerily insistent number one hit graced by some of the best use of sitar (played by Brian Jones) on a rock record. Other classics included the jazzy \"Under My Thumb,\" where Jones added exotic accents with his vibes, and the delicate Elizabethan ballad \"Lady Jane,\" where dulcimer can be heard. Some of the material is fairly ho-hum, to be honest, as Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were still prone to inconsistent songwriting; \"Goin' Home,\" an 11-minute blues jam, was remarkable, more for its barrier-crashing length than its content. Look out for an obscure gem, however, in the brooding, meditative \"I Am Waiting.\" [This is the Japanese edition of the CD.] ~ Richie Unterberger",

        "summary": "During the five years between AHJ and Â¿Como Te Llama?, Albert Hammond, Jr. completed rehab and reunited with the Strokes for two albums, 2011's Angles and 2013's Comedown Machine. It's hard not to feel that this work ethic rubbed off on his solo career: Hammond made AHJ an EP instead of another full-length in order to showcase his best songs -- a markedly different approach than he took on his previous solo work, where his let-it-all-hang-out aesthetic was a big part of the charm. Producer Gus Oberg, who also helped craft the Strokes' 2010s albums, helps Hammond forge a sound that complements his previous solo work as well as his legacy with that band. The brittle riff that begins \"St. Justice\" is unmistakably Hammond, and much more guitar-driven than the music his main band was making at the time. Â¿Como Te Llama? already had a handful of songs that recalled the Strokes, so AHJ's focus on that side of Hammond's music feels natural, and at times even more inspired than the band's latter-day material. The Strokes' best songs generated sparks with the friction of their cheeky and heartfelt impulses, and while Hammond is more earnest here than the Strokes ever were, or on his earlier work for that matter, there's a similar tug of war between AHJ's bouncy veneers and melancholy undercurrents. This is especially true of the EP's standout track, \"Strange Tidings,\" which feels more intimate and confessional in its recriminations (\"Watch what you say/If I'm guilty, I will pay\") than the similarly moody songs by his other band. Though the EP format doesn't leave much room for dabbling or dawdling, Hammond does find time to temper his newfound clarity with a little of his old mischief on \"Rude Customer,\" a blend of rip-roaring guitars and clipped, almost British-sounding vocals. Jaunty and jagged, AHJ is easily Hammond's most consistent release. For perhaps the first time, his solo work feels less like a tangent to his work with the Strokes and more like something sustainable in its own right. ~ Heather Phares",

And yes, the rational response to that information would be to say, \"Oh good, another German electronica artist with Third World pretensions.\" But if you hold your perfectly reasonable suspicions in abeyance for about 15 minutes, Scherl may well win you over with his nicely developed melodies, subdued but funky beats, and complex sonic textures. (Maybe not so much with the ocean and forest sounds, which are supposed to evoke a knee-jerk purchasing reaction in right-thinking people everywhere.) What makes this music so attractive is Scherl's two-pronged strategy of bringing the beats right up to the front, and finding good singers to sample and using the samples well. Notice, for example, the combination of African and European voices on \"Coming Home\" and the dubwise treatment he applies to the gorgeous choral singers on \"Mama.\" Whether or not you buy into the utopian visions of global oneness that give rise to music like this, the music itself is quite special. ~ Rick Anderson",

        "summary": "Generationals' fourth studio album, 2014's Alix, features more of the '80s-influenced electronic pop and indie rock the New Orleans duo has perfected since 2009's Con Law. Once again showcasing the combined talents of Ted Joyner and Grant Widmer, Alix is a catchy, brightly colored affair with songs built largely around the duo's yearning, nasally vocals, buoyant synth lines, and dance-oriented, if not exactly club-ready, beats. In some ways, the album picks up on the languid, late-summer vibe of 2013's Heza, taking it even further with dreamy, melancholy cuts like \"Now Look at Me,\" and the fuzzy, bubbly \"Black Lemon.\" Also similar to the group's past albums, Alix sounds a lot like a lost synth pop album from the early '80s, full of melodic, lightly arty cuts that bring to mind such vintage influences as Tom Tom Club, Nu Shooz, and Thomas Dolby. That said, Alix is anything but a retro album and cuts like the '50s-infused \"Gold Silver Diamond,\" and the clipped, new wave-inflected \"Charlemagne\" also fit nicely alongside such similarly leaning contemporary acts as MGMT, Phoenix, Fun. and Passion Pit. Ultimately, with Alix, Generationals deliver quirky, catchy pop songs that stick in your head like DayGlo bubblegum on a hot summer parking lot. [Alix was also released on LP.] ~ Matt Collar",

        "summary": "Bad Blood reveals that Bastille is a synth-driven band that isn't particularly arty, something of a rarity during the electronic pop revival of the 2000s and 2010s. Where many of their contemporaries used the glamour of synth-pop's '80s heyday and electronic music's infinite possibilities to craft shiny pop fantasies, Bastille builds on the glossy, anthemic approach they set forth on the Laura Palmer EP (the title track, which is included here, might also be the least arty song inspired by David Lynch's surreal soap opera Twin Peaks). Early highlights like \"Pompeii,\" \"These Streets,\" and the title track boast panoramic choruses and sleek arrangements that hint at a kinship with Empire of the Sun and Delphic, while the handclaps and popping bassline on the otherwise moody \"Icarus\" recall Hot Chip at their most confessional. However, most of Bad Blood suggests that Bastille are actually an electronically enhanced upgrade of sweeping British pop traditionalists like Keane or Coldplay. The band updates \"Oblivion\"'s piano balladry with ping-ponging drums and contrasts Dan Smith's throaty singing and searching lyrics (\"There's a hole in my soul/Can you fill it?\") with a tumbling  beat on \"Flaws.\" Like the aforementioned acts, Bastille has a way with heartfelt melodies and choruses that resonate, particularly on the driving \"Things We Lost in the Fire\" and \"Get Home,\" where the slightly processed vocals also evoke Sia, Imogen Heap, and other electronic-friendly singer/songwriters. While the band occasionally gets a little too self-serious on the album's second half, Bad Blood is a solid, polished debut that fans of acts like Snow Patrol (who don't mind more electronics in the mix) might appreciate more than synth-pop aficionados.

Returning fans, drug scientists, and those who know their Imuran from their Azathioprine may beg to differ, but like Watsky, they're thinking along the narrow and not the broad. Still, if well-written and bulging diaries are appealing, All You Can Do is just what the doctor ordered. ~ David Jeffries",

        "summary": "For Widowspeak, the years after the release of 2013's Almanac and the Swamps EP were marked by departures and returns: Molly Hamilton and Robert Earl Thomas left Brooklyn for the Catskills and reunited with Woods' Jarvis Taveniere, who produced their debut, when it was time to make All Yours. Using his gift for making any album he works on sound effortless, Taveniere helps them embrace Almanac's velvety country and classic rock even more fully and naturally, with results that sound more fresh-faced than theatrical. Compared to the duo's other albums, All Yours is downright restrained: \"Hands\" echoes the gentle drift of their debut even though it glides along on tasteful strings and keyboards instead of distorted guitars, while \"Narrows\" transforms the duo's lingering shoegaze impulses into shimmering drones. However, this pared-down approach makes room for Widowspeak's increasing twang to emerge even more confidently on the title track, as well as for more adventurous moves like \"My Baby's Gonna Carry On,\" which uses '60s and '70s psych-rock trappings -- a \"Sunshine Superman\" bassline, rippling Rhodes fills, and busy percussion -- in ways that sound remarkably ungimmicky. All Yours also puts the spotlight on just how much Widowspeak's songwriting has grown over the years; \"Coke Bottle Green\" is a fascinating combination of traditional country and folk structure and 21st century domesticity (\"I want windows I can fill/With any life I can't kill\"). Like Fleetwood Mac, whose influence permeated Almanac, Hamilton and Thomas excel at setting heartbroken lyrics to addictively catchy melodies. All Yours is filled with painful memories lying just underneath its honeyed surface; \"Dead Love (You're So Still)\" cloaks frustration with an old flame in head-bobbing hooks. Hamilton sounds as sweet as ever on these barbed, ambivalent songs, whether she's lamenting a galaxy's worth of emotional distance on \"Cosmically Aligned\" or chasing a feeling as fleeting as a high on the gorgeous \"Stoned.\" Nevertheless, her most thoughtful lyrics aren't about a lover, but her relationship to other, younger women: as she sings \"Further from my wilder years/I get kinder to the younger girls\" over guitars that burn like a grudge, \"Girls\" illustrates the dance between jealousy and affection simply and brilliantly. Moments like these make All Yours Widowspeak's most self-assured and vulnerable album yet. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "Alone in the Universe isn't the first Jeff Lynne album of the 21st century, nor is it the first Electric Light Orchestra of the 21st century. That honor belongs to Zoom, a 2001 comeback that faded quickly into history books, its lack of success blamed in some quarters on Lynne's reluctance to tour. If Jeff didn't want to hit the road, his old bandmate Bev Bevan had no problem constituting a lineup and touring under the name ELO Part II, whose presence somewhat explains why Alone in the Universe is credited to the somewhat convoluted Jeff Lynne's ELO -- a truncation of the band's full name that also assigns credit where it's due, as most listeners associate this majestic post-Abbey Road pop with Lynne alone. Certainly, Alone in the Universe is recognizably the work of Lynne: harmonies so sweet they'd induce cavities, stately midtempo marches that just avoid the appearance of pomp, a devotion to both McCartney-esque melody and Martin-esque production, spiked by an ode to George Harrison's slide guitar. At 32 minutes, Alone in the Universe is remarkably devoid of excess -- notably, it's just five minutes longer than his breezy 2012 covers album Long Wave -- but it doesn't feel shrugged off, nor does it feel especially attached to its time. Lynne abandons some of the clean-cut sharp edges of his early-'90s productions so he can happily live in the late '70s -- there are echoes of disco on \"One Step at a Time\" and the entire enterprise carries a sci-fi aura, even if it never is fantastical or prog -- and there's an appeal to his long looks back because he's not pandering to nostalgia: he's simply embracing who he is. If he hasn't written a knockout single -- a high bar for a craftsman of 67 to clear -- he's nevertheless sculpted ten strong songs, each one containing a sturdy melodic foundation and dressed in the handsomest threads of 1978. For many longtime followers of Lynne and ELO, that will be all they need from Alone in the Universe. [Alone in the Universe was also released on LP.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Canadian quintet Alvvays (pronounced \"Always\") burst out of the gates with their self-titled 2014 debut, a brief but bright collection of nine songs of nearly perfect, sugar-coated indie pop. The band call on inspiration from the jangly C-86 movement and bands like the Wedding Present or Talulah Gosh, but also lean on the fuzzy, homespun spirit of early American independent bedroom pop and twee while steeping their tunes in a languid dreaminess borrowed from Teenage Fanclub at their most wistful. The album opens with the one-two punch of \"Adult Diversion\" and \"Archie, Marry Me,\" two single-worthy songs of noisy guitars, gloriously deadpan vocal harmonies, and sticky melodies cemented in the listener's skull by the interplay between guitar and singer Molly Rankin's cascading vocals. The album is full of highlights, from the synthy melancholia of \"Party Police\" to the Orange Juice-esque interweaving guitar lines of \"Atop a Cake.\" While Alvvays relies on the same reverb-heavy production that an entire generation of beach-obsessed indie pop bands has tended toward, they surpass many of their peers by delivering more inspired songs, often with unexpected shifts or breakthrough moments. This debut surpasses simply being \"promising\" by delivering pop as beautifully composed as that of contemporaries like Pains of Being Pure at Heart or Veronica Falls, while also tying in sentiments of punk gusto, twee wonderment, and dream pop thoughtfulness without relying strictly on the musical blueprints of any of those genres. Instead, Alvvays find a way to articulate their heart-struck, dream-like songs with deft intention and control. [Alvvays was also released on LP.] ~ Fred Thomas",

        "summary": "A practical, no-frills clamshell box set celebrating the soft rock/folk-pop hitmakers' '70s heyday, the Warner Bros. Years 1971-1977 rounds up seven complete studio albums and one live LP. Comprised of America (1971), Homecoming (1972), Hat Trick (1973), Holiday (1974), Hearts (1975), Hideaway (1976), Harbor (1977), and America Live (1977), all of which were remastered in 2014, the collection is aimed squarely at completists. Like their closest sonic contemporaries Seals & Crofts, the trio of Gerry Beckley, Dewey Bunnell, and Dan Peek was an unstoppable FM/AM radio force for the era, securing future classic soft rock staples like \"Horse with No Name,\" \"Ventura Highway,' \"Muskrat Love,\" \"Tin Man,\" \"Lonely People,\" and \"Sister Golden Hair,\" many of which were impeccably produced by George Martin. Really the only thing missing here is the group's 1982 comeback hit \"You Can Do Magic,\" which would make Rhino's excellent 2000 Highway: 30 Years of America the better choice for casual fans, but longtime America devotees will appreciate having the new studio masters all in one place, as well as the neatly arranged original album art and inserts. ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "It's a bit tempting to peg Green Day's sprawling, ambitious, brilliant seventh album, American Idiot, as their version of a Who album, the next logical step forward from the Kinks-inspired popcraft of their underrated 2000 effort, Warning, but things aren't quite that simple. American Idiot is an unapologetic, unabashed rock opera, a form that Pete Townshend pioneered with Tommy, but Green Day doesn't use that for a blueprint as much as they use the Who's mini-opera \"A Quick One, While He's Away,\" whose whirlwind succession of 90-second songs isn't only emulated on two song suites here, but provides the template for the larger 13-song cycle. But the Who are only one of many inspirations on this audacious, immensely entertaining album. The story of St. Jimmy has an arc similar to HÃ¼sker DÃ¼'s landmark punk-opera Zen Arcade, while the music has grandiose flourishes straight out of both Queen and Rocky Horror Picture Show (the '50s pastiche \"Rock and Roll Girlfriend\" is punk rock Meat Loaf), all tied together with a nervy urgency and a political passion reminiscent of the Clash, or all the anti-Reagan American hardcore bands of the '80s. These are just the clearest touchstones for American Idiot, but reducing the album to its influences gives the inaccurate impression that this is no more than a patchwork quilt of familiar sounds, when it's an idiosyncratic, visionary work in its own right. First of all, part of Green Day's appeal is how they have personalized the sounds of the past, making time-honored guitar rock traditions seem fresh, even vital. With their first albums, they styled themselves after first-generation punk they were too young to hear firsthand, and as their career progressed, the group not only synthesized these influences into something distinctive, but chief songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong turned into a muscular, versatile songwriter in his own right. \r\nWarning illustrated their growing musical acumen quite impressively, but here, the music isn't only tougher, it's fluid and, better still, it fuels the anger, disillusionment, heartbreak, frustration, and scathing wit at the core of American Idiot. And one of the truly startling things about American Idiot is how the increased musicality of the band is matched by Armstrong's incisive, cutting lyrics, which effectively convey the paranoia and fear of living in American in days after 9/11, but also veer into moving, intimate small-scale character sketches. There's a lot to absorb here, and cynics might dismiss it after one listen as a bit of a mess when it's really a rich, multi-faceted work, one that is bracing upon the first spin and grows in stature and becomes more addictive with each repeated play. Like all great concept albums, American Idiot works on several different levels. It can be taken as a collection of great songs -- songs that are as visceral or as poignant as Green Day at their best, songs that resonate outside of the larger canvas of the story, as the fiery anti-Dubya title anthem proves -- but these songs have a different, more lasting impact when taken as a whole. While its breakneck, freewheeling musicality has many inspirations, there really aren't many records like American Idiot (bizarrely enough, the Fiery Furnaces' Blueberry Boat is one of the closest, at least on a sonic level, largely because both groups draw deeply from the kaleidoscopic \"A Quick One\"). In its musical muscle and sweeping, politically charged narrative, it's something of a masterpiece, and one of the few -- if not the only -- records of 2004 to convey what it feels like to live in the strange, bewildering America of the early 2000s. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "American V: A Hundred Highways is the long-awaited album of Johnny Cash's final recordings, the basic tracks for which (i.e., Cash's vocals) were recorded in 2002-2003, with overdubs added by producer Rick Rubin after his death on September 12, 2003, at age 71. Between 1994 and 2002, Cash and Rubin had succeeded in fashioning a third act for the veteran country singer's career, following his acclaimed 1950s work for Sun Records and his popular recordings for Columbia in the 1960s and '70s. In the '80s, Cash's star had faded, but Rubin reinvented him as a hip country-folk-rock elder at 62 with American Recordings (1994), his first new studio album to reach the pop charts in 18 years. Unchained (1996) and American III: Solitary Man (2000) continued the comeback, at least as far as the critics were concerned, though none of the albums was actually a big seller. But American IV: The Man Comes Around (2002), propelled by Cash's cover of Nine Inch Nails' \"Hurt\" and a powerful video, stayed in the pop charts longer than any Cash album since 1969's Johnny Cash at San Quentin. By 2002, however, Cash was in failing health, homebound and in a wheelchair, and he suffered a personal blow when his wife, June Carter Cash, died on May 15, 2003.  The American series, which posited Cash as an aged sage and the repository for a bottomless American songbook, had already shown a predilection for gloom in the name of gravity; it's no surprise that the fifth and final volume would be even more concerned with, as three earlier Cash compilations had put it, God, Love, and Murder. The ailing septuagenarian certainly sounds like he's near the end of his life, but that said, he doesn't sound bad. Cash was never a great singer in a technical sense: he hadn't much range, his pitch often wobbled, and his lack of breath control sometimes found him grasping for sound at the end of lines. But he was a great singer in the sense of projecting a persona through his voice; his emotional range, which went from a Sinatra-like swagger to an almost embarrassingly intimate vulnerability, was as wide as the spread of notes he could hit confidently was narrow. Such a singer doesn't really lose that much with age; in fact, he gains even more interpretive depth. Listening to this album, one can't get around the knowledge that it is a posthumous collection made in Cash's last days, but even without that context, it would have much the same impact. \r\nThe album begins with two religious songs, Larry Gatlin's \"Help Me,\" a plea to God, and the traditional \"God's Gonna Cut You Down,\" which, in a sense, answers that plea. The finality of death thus established, Cash launches into what is billed as the last song he ever wrote, \"Like the 309,\" which is about a train taking his casket away. The same image is used later in the cover of Hank Williams' \"On the Evening Train,\" in which a man and his child put the coffin of a wife and mother on another train. Cash sings these songs in a restrained manner, and even has a sense of humor in \"Like the 309,\" in which he complains about his asthma: \"It should be awhile/Before I see Doctor Death/So it would sure be nice/If I could get my breath.\" In between the two train songs come songs that may not have been about death when their authors wrote them, but sure sound like they are here. As written, Gordon Lightfoot's \"If You Could Read My Mind\" seems to concern a romantic breakup expressed in literary and cinematic terms, but in Cash's voice, lines like \"You know that ghost is me\" and \"But stories always end\" become inescapably elegiac. Bruce Springsteen's \"Further On (Up the Road)\" is even easier to interpret as a call to the hereafter, with lines like \"Got on my dead man's suit and my smilin' skull ring/My lucky graveyard boots and song to sing.\" These two songs make a pair with the album's two closing songs. Ian Tyson's \"Four Strong Winds\" is, like the Lightfoot selection, a folk standard by a Canadian songwriter, also nominally about romantic dissolution, although here the singer who is \"bound for moving on\" doesn't seem likely to come back. And the closing song, \"I'm Free from the Chain Gang Now,\" may have lyrics implying that the unjustly imprisoned narrator has been set free, but in Cash's voice it sounds like he's been executed instead and is singing from beyond the grave. The four songs in between \"On the Evening Train\" and \"Four Strong Winds,\" dealing with faith and love (the former expressed in a previously recorded 1984 Cash copyright, \"I Came to Believe\"), are weaker than what surrounds them, but they serve to complete the picture. And it's worth noting that Cash at death's door still outsings croaking Rod McKuen on the songwriter's ever-cloying \"Love's Been Good to Me.\" Cash may never have heard Rubin's overdubs, but they are restrained and tasteful, never doing anything more than to support the singer and the song. If the entire series of American recordings makes for a fitting finale to a great career, American V: A Hundred Highways is a more than respectable coda. ~William Ruhlmann",

A simple instrumentation of guitars and keyboards, augmented here and there by British folk-rock veterans like Richard Thompson, Danny Thompson, and Dave Mattacks, serves to set up a series of songs of romantic disillusionment. Declaring \"my life is just an image of a roller coaster, anyway\" and \"I don't understand anything,\" among other things, over and over the songs speak of confusion and disappointment deriving from failed love affairs. The approach is much more introspective than that taken on the group's previous album of new music, Worldwide, but Tracey Thorn and Ben Watt's musical restraint supports it well. This is an album to listen to when you've just broken up with your lover, or even when you're just in the mood to think about lost lovers from long ago -- self-pity set to music. ~ William Ruhlmann",

        "summary": "Shakey Graves is the stage name of Austin, Texas-based singer, songwriter, and musician Alejandro Rose-Garcia, who is probably better known under his real name as an actor, having appeared in several movies and who has had a recurring role in the television series Friday Night Lights. As a musician, however, he's his own species, really, having developed a kind of one-man band \"hobo folk\" approach to songwriting and performance. His sound is kind of alt-country, but only sort of, and yeah, he's folky, too, but what really makes his songs something different is his innate pop sense. His melodies rise and ebb and crest like waves, gentle and forever flowing forward, and the best of his songs are simply beautiful and haunting. This is his second album, following 2011's Roll the Bones, and it's a lovely, hushed, stark, and yet sturdy set that soothes even as it startles. Songs like \"Only Son,\" \"Big Time Nashville Star,\" and \"Call It Heaven\" are eerie little folk-pop masterpieces, and Rose-Garcia's voice is a subtle, emotive tool, as is his sparse but effective guitar playing. There probably isn't a radio hit here, because his songs are built around melody rather than box-your-ears rhythms and beats, but they have a melancholic and angelic tone to them that gently takes one's breath away. [And the War Came was also released on LP.] ~ Steve Leggett",

        "summary": "Australian sibling folk-rock duo Angus & Julia Stone broke big with their 2010 sophomore album, Down the Way. The album, which debuted at number one in Australia, took home five ARIA music awards, including Album of the Year. On the heels of their success, the famously shy duo began work on a follow-up, but eventually shelved the idea in favor of taking some time off to pursue solo work. However, coaxed back into the studio by super-producer Rick Rubin, the Stone siblings eventually returned to their ruminative, melodic, and often melancholy collaborations with 2014's Angus & Julia Stone. In many ways, what you see is pretty much what you get from the Stones, with their shaggy hair and hippie-chic clothes matching their penchant for acoustic introspection. Indeed, there aren't too many surprises here, with the siblings sticking to their formula: intimate, folky songs with poignant lyrics that usually bend toward the darker, sadder aspects of life. What commands your attention, however, is the way that Julia's cherubic, sandpaper doll of a voice contrasts with Angus' more clear-toned and casual vocal style. They also display a knack for coming up with lyrics that contain bittersweet, poetic juxtapositions, always hinting at deeper, more complex emotions. On \"Other Things,\" duetting in clipped unison phrases, they sing \"Go put the cat outside/'Cos we've got things to do,\" and \"There's a plane in the sky/If those people fall they will die/I've got other things on my mind.\" It's this kind of focus on the ennui, the mundane tragedy that permeates many people's daily lives, that works as creative fodder for Angus & Julia Stone. Ultimately, it's that ennui, combined with the pair's heartbreaking sense of melody, that makes this album a delightfully sad yet engaging listen. ~ Matt Collar",

Essentially built around two startlingly affecting diatribes on the war in Iraq, Ritter utilizes the voices of Peter and Paul, as well as Laurel & Hardy, to eke some kind of explanation from both the Administration and the Creator. The first, the deceptively sweet-sounding \"Girl in the War,\" threatens \"The angels fly around in there, but we can't see them/I got a girl in the war, Paul I know that they can hear me yell/If they can't find a way to help her they can go to Hell.\" The second, \"Thin Blue Flame,\" is a nearly ten-minute rant that follows the Velvet Underground \"Heroin\" arc of tinder to spark to full-on blaze in a way that hasn't worked for anyone in a long time, but most certainly does here. The other cuts never reach the same heights, but standouts such as \"Wolves,\" with its sunrise gallop and \"Whole of the Moon\"-era Waterboys piano, and the languid \"Monster Ballads\" soar only inches beneath them.

        "summary": "A universally acknowledged masterpiece, Another Green World represents a departure from song structure and toward a more ethereal, minimalistic approach to sound. Despite the stripped-down arrangements, the album's sumptuous tone quality reflects Eno's growing virtuosity at handling the recording studio as an instrument in itself (Ã  la Brian Wilson). There are a few pop songs scattered here and there (\"St. Elmo's Fire,\" \"I'll Come Running,\" \"Golden Hours\"), but most of the album consists of deliberately paced instrumentals that, while often closer to ambient music than pop, are both melodic and rhythmic; many, like \"Sky Saw,\" \"In Dark Trees,\" and \"Little Fishes,\" are highly imagistic, like paintings done in sound that actually resemble their titles. Lyrics are infrequent, but when they do pop up, they follow the free-associative style of albums past; this time, though, the humor seems less bizarre than gently whimsical and addled, fitting perfectly into the dreamlike mood of the rest of the album. Most of Another Green World is like experiencing a soothing, dream-filled slumber while awake, and even if some of the pieces have dark or threatening qualities, the moments of unease are temporary, like a passing nightmare whose feeling lingers briefly upon waking but whose content is forgotten. Unlike some of his later, full-fledged ambient work, Eno's gift for melodicism and tight focus here keep the entirety of the album in the forefront of the listener's consciousness, making it the perfect introduction to his achievements even for those who find ambient music difficult to enjoy. ~ Steve Huey",

This set basically offers all the singles and album rock radio favorites, with a couple of odd selections here and there and one new song, \"Surrender.\" There are a few omissions -- \"Make It Better (Forget About Me)\" isn't here, for instance -- but not enough to really be noticeable, especially since this consolidates the bulk of Petty's great songs and plays very, very well. Greatest Hits might have a slight edge to Anthology because of its conciseness, but this double-disc set illustrates that Petty's catalog was deeper than just the hits. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Continuing their evolution from straight-up Nashville roots-folk act to purveyors of lush indie pop, the Apache Relay turn in a more refined and distinctively less Southern set for their third effort. A six-piece sporting a full rhythm section, the band has come a long way since the dusty Americana of their 2009 debut 1988, which was billed as Michael Ford Jr. & the Apache Relay. Two years later, they solidified their approach and shortened their band name with American Nomad, a more rock-oriented album that still relied on a certain rootsy, open-road twang. With their self-titled third album, the band eschews Nashville altogether, instead traveling to L.A. to work with esteemed producer Kevin Augunas (the Lumineers, Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros) at Fairfax Recordings (formerly the legendary Sound City). The resulting album ultimately feels more honed and more unified than anything else they've done. Lead single and album-opener \"Katie Queen of Tennessee\" is a sublime blend of orchestrated, late-'50s countrypolitan and Fleet Foxes-era indie pop. Its deeply reverbed vocal blend and dense, acoustic strumming sets the tone for the rest of the album's 11 cuts which retain an essence of the band's roots sound, but filtered through Augunas' acoustic Wall of Sound. The clever use of mixed hand percussion and a minimalist drum kit endows many of the tracks with catchy rhythmic hooks, like on the punchy, shimmering \"Ruby\" and the moody \"Good as Gold.\" Perhaps the album isn't a complete reinvention of the band, but it's definitely a case where applying some very distinct stylization to their songs gives the band a very different impression than last time around. The stripping away of more overtly country ornamentations like mandolin and fiddle in favor of piano, organ, and strings complements Ford's new, more pop-flavored songs, making for the band's most interesting and engaging album yet. ~ Timothy Monger",

        "summary": "Montreal quartet Wolf Parade's full-length debut fully lives up to the potential bred by their early EPs. They use Apologies to the Queen Mary producer Isaac Brock to their best advantage, acknowledging their debt to Modest Mouse but using his ear as a resource to tinge their endearingly brittle indie pop tunes accordingly. Spencer Krug and Dan Boeckner both sing in that certain kind of wry yelp that seemed so quirkily marketable in the mid-2000s -- see the Shins, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Hot Hot Heat -- and it doesn't hurt that most of Wolf Parade's songs are distinctive, too. \"Shine a Light\" and \"You Are a Runner and I Am My Father's Son\" repeat from the self-titled EP, \"Grounds and Divorce\" bops along on cheery keyboard effects and an eight-note guitar solo, and Boeckner honks roughly over the modified new wave of \"It's a Curse.\" Wolf Parade admit their love and theft of the past 30 years of rock music, from Bowie to Black Francis. They allow that, then purposely strip the songs of any slickness or accouterments, so the keys and squiggly guitars and terrifically simple drums (Arlen Thompson might play just a kick drum and one big snare) teeter and balance together in a hectic and gloriously alive pop state. ~ Johnny Loftus",

        "summary": "Guns N' Roses' debut, Appetite for Destruction was a turning point for hard rock in the late '80s -- it was a dirty, dangerous, and mean record in a time when heavy metal meant nothing but a good time. On the surface, Guns N' Roses may appear to celebrate the same things as their peers -- namely, sex, liquor, drugs, and rock & roll -- but there is a nasty edge to their songs, since Axl Rose doesn't see much fun in the urban sprawl of L.A. and its parade of heavy metal thugs, cheap women, booze, and crime. The music is as nasty as the lyrics, wallowing in a bluesy, metallic hard rock borrowed from Aerosmith, AC/DC, and countless faceless hard rock bands of the early '80s. It's a primal, sleazy sound that adds grit to already grim tales. It also makes Rose's misogyny, fear, and anger hard to dismiss as merely an artistic statement; this is music that sounds lived-in. And that's exactly why Appetite for Destruction is such a powerful record -- not only does Rose have fears, but he also is vulnerable, particularly on the power ballad \"Sweet Child O' Mine.\" He also has a talent for conveying the fears and horrors of the decaying inner city, whether it's on the charging \"Welcome to the Jungle,\" the heroin ode \"Mr. Brownstone,\" or \"Paradise City,\" which simply wants out. But as good as Rose's lyrics and screeching vocals are, they wouldn't be nearly as effective without the twin-guitar interplay of Slash and Izzy Stradlin, who spit out riffs and solos better than any band since the Rolling Stones, and that's what makes Appetite for Destruction the best metal record of the late '80s.

        "summary": "The John Butler Trio, Australiaâs biggest contribution to the jam band movement, gets a serious makeover on 2010's April Uprising. Butler dissolved the previous lineup one year before this albumâs release, hoping to keep things fresh with a change in personnel. Newcomers Byron Luiters and Nicky Bomba (Butlerâs brother-in-law) make their debut here, and the band further reinvents itself by sticking closer to the alt-rock camp than ever before, with Butler trading his fingerplucked guitar arpeggios for electric riffs and power chords. Heâs not entirely done with the genres that fueled his earlier albums -- reggae, folk, pop, and acoustic soul chief among them -- and songs like âDonât Wanna See Your Faceâ are familiarly funky, with grooves specifically designed for the festival crowds that sustain the John Butler Trio every summer. Even so, April Uprising signals a change in direction, with a newfound emphasis on rock textures and political lyrics (âSometimes I do wonder how we do sleep/Serving the dodgy companies we keepâ) that make the band sound like a flashier, Aussie equivalent of State Radio. ~ Andrew Leahey",

        "summary": "The leap from 1970's Benefit to the following year's Aqualung is one of the most astonishing progressions in rock history. In the space of one album, Tull went from relatively unassuming electrified folk-rock to larger-than-life conceptual rock full of sophisticated compositions and complex, intellectual, lyrical constructs. While the leap to full-blown prog rock wouldn't be taken until a year later on Thick as a Brick, the degree to which Tull upped the ante here is remarkable.\r\nThe lyrical concept -- the hypocrisy of Christianity in England -- is stronger than on most other '70s conceptual efforts, but it's ultimately the music that makes it worthy of praise. Tull's winning way with a riff was never so arresting as on the chugging \"Locomotive Breath,\" or on the character studies \"Cross Eyed Mary\" and \"Aqualung,\" which portray believably seedy participants in Ian Anderson's story. The fable imagery of \"Mother Goose\" and the vitriolic anti-authoritarian sentiments of \"Wind Up\" both serve notice of Anderson's willful iconoclasm and his disillusionment with the spiritual traditions to which he was born. Varied but cohesive, Aqualung is widely regarded as Tull's finest hour. [Aqualung was released in a two-CD/two-DVD box set in 2016.] ~ Rovi Staff",

        "summary": "Brooklyn singer/songwriter Sharon Van Etten's transfixing voice and often heart-wrenching songs come through in an odd mixture of pain and flourishing inspiration on the best moments of her fourth album, Are We There. The album, produced by Van Etten herself with some help from New York-based producer Stewart Lerman (Elvis Costello, Sophie B. Hawkins), follows her 2012 outing Tramp and trades up on some of the crushed indie templates of that album for new stylistic territory. From her first hushed demo-like recordings, Van Etten's songs have more often than not found their lyrical core stemming from painful relationships and hard times, culminating in Tramp's tales of homelessness, uncertainty, and desperation. Are We There's 11 selections also mine her harrowed heart for inspiration, be it the slow-burning portrait of a toxic love/hate romance in \"Your Love Is Killing Me\" or the obsessed fixation on an absent lover in \"Break Me.\" While there's still a fair amount of heartbreak and pain in the subject matter of the songs, the folky strums and indie rock clatter of Tramp and earlier records have been expanded upon with more inventive musical approaches, leaving the album feeling much brighter, even in its darkest moments. \"Taking Chances\" is guided by an unexpectedly slinking bassline and minimal drum machine clicks, Van Etten's voice melting like honey over their laid-back foundations before introducing rawkus guitars on the chorus. Similar instrumentation shows up on \"Our Love,\" a steady drum machine and lonely organ drone setting the stage for the brilliantly arranged multi-tracked harmonies and an indie take on the sophisticated tones of '80s quiet storm R&B. Even when tending toward more familiar rock sounds, the arrangements on Are We There are more considered, colorful, and ornate than ever before. Where previous albums felt a little too anchored to Van Etten's samey guitar changes, here tracks like \"Tarifa\" explode with sure-footed horn sections, nostalgic Hammond organ, and spirals of anthemic vocal harmonies. Quieter songs like \"I Know\" and \"I Love You But I'm Lost\" are driven by piano, leaving lots of space for the vocals to soar, while the cinematic textures and haunted guitar twang of \"You Know Me Well\" could almost draw comparisons to Lana Del Rey in her more Twin Peaks moments. The more inventive arrangements and advances in songwriting are an undeniable step forward for Van Etten. While still immersed in songs of emotional ravagement and betrayal, the confidence of her performances and spectrum of sounds represented here suggest a complete graduation from troubled, uncertain roots into a place where she can deliver her songs with a powerful, borderless command. [Are We There was also released on LP.] ~ Fred Thomas",

        "summary": "Arriving after a six-year silence, ArrangingTime does seem like something of a rebirth for Pete Yorn: it finds the singer/songwriter re-teaming with his original producer R. Walt Vincent and debuting on a shiny new major label, Capitol. Yorn didn't quite disappear in the time since 2010's eponymous Black Francis-produced album -- he paired with J.D. King on the 2013 project the Olms -- but in a sense it seemed like he was wandering in the wilderness for even longer, never quite capitalizing on the promise he showed in the dawning days of the 21st century. On ArrangingTime, he doesn't seem anxious to recapture his puppy-dog optimism, nor does he seem bitter -- bruised, maybe, happy to slide into the smooth, slow electronic pulse that blankets the album. This manicured mellowness feels mature, a progression from a past that is nevertheless referenced: \"In Your Head\" recalls his original idol Ryan Adams and \"Halifax\" echoes \"Black,\" yet there's little suggestion that Yorn is eager to recapture the mantle of the guitar-wielding troubadour so anxious to aspire to authenticity. Now a little bit older and wiser, Yorn feels settled in his skin, as happy to strum a song or sharpen a new wave hook (\"Screaming at the Setting Sun\") as he is to linger in pretty melancholy. On this record, Yorn seems to master mood more than tune, but that winds up being to his benefit. This tonal elasticity gives ArrangingTime an enveloping warmth, one that is alluring even if it tends to shift concentration away from the songwriting that allegedly was his greatest strength.

        "parentTitle": "Van Morrison",
        "summary": "Astral Weeks is generally considered one of the best albums in pop music history, but for all that renown, it is anything but an archetypal rock and roll album. It it isn't a rock and roll album at all. Van Morrison plays acoustic guitar and sings in his elastic, bluesy, soulful voice, accompanied by crack group of jazz studio players: guitarist Jay Berliner, upright bassist Richard Davis, Modern Jazz Quartet drummer Connie Kay, vibraphonist Warren Smith and soprano saxophonist John Payne (also credited on flute, though that's debatable--some claim an anonymous flautist provided those parts). Producer Lewis Merenstein added chamber orchestrations later and divided the album into halves: \"In The Beginning\" and \"Afterwards\" with four tunes under each heading. Morrison's songs are an instinctive, organic mixture of Celtic folk, blues and jazz. He fully enters the mystic here, more in the moment than he ever would be again in a recording studio. If his pop hit \"Brown-Eyed Girl\" was the first place he explored the \"previous\"--i.e. the depths of his memory--for inspiration and direction, he immerses himself in it here. The freewheeling, loose feel adds to the intimacy and immediacy in the songs. They are for the most part, extended, incantory, loosely narrative and poetic ruminations on his Belfast upbringing: its characters, shops, streets, alleys, and sidewalks, all framed by the innocence and passage of that era. Morrison seems hypnotized by his subjects; they comfort and haunt a present filled with inexhaustible longing and loneliness. He confesses as much in the title track: \"If I ventured in the slipstream/Between the viaducts of your dream/Where immobile steel rims crack/And the ditch in the back roads stop/ Could you find me?/ Would you kiss-a my eyes/... To be born again....\" Morrison doesn't reach out to the listener, but goes deep inside himself to excavate and explore. The album's centerpiece is \"Madame George\" a stream-of-consciousness narrative of personal psychological and spiritual archetypes deeply influenced by the road novels of Jack Kerouac. The climactic epiphany experienced on \"Cyprus Avenue\" paints a portrait of place and time so vividly, it fools listeners into the experience of shared---but mythical--memory. \"The Way Young Lovers Do\" is the most fully-formed tune here. Its swinging jazz verses and tight rhythmic choruses underscore a simmering, passionate eroticism in Morrison's lyric and delivery. Astral Weeks is a justified entry in pop music's pantheon. It is unlike any record before or since; it mixes together the very best of postwar popular music in an emotional outpouring cast in delicate, subtle, musical structures. ~ William Ruhlmann",

        "summary": "Although sparsely attended to with strings, percussion, and a few other ornamentations, Benjamin Clementine's debut album, At Least for Now, makes its case as a one-man show for piano and voice. The compelling British singer/songwriter is dramatic, self-assured, and theatrical in the extreme, boasting a powerful voice that swells to fill the room, which, on this unique record, seems to expand and shrink at the drop of a hat. A native of Edmonton in East London, Clementine left home at 16, eventually devoting himself to the lifestyle of an artistic vagabond, busking on the streets of Paris where he developed an unconventional style that blends together bits of soul, classical, opera, and street folk. A chance discovery by a French promoter led to bigger performances, a pair of acclaimed EPs, and a deal with Capitol. Opening his debut with \"Winston Churchill's Boy,\" he boldly repurposes parts of the prime minister's famed WWII speech into an austere paean to his own journey of self-discovery. Like many of the songs on At Least for Now, it takes time to develop, but his magnetic delivery commands attention and his unusual songcraft is consistently interesting. \"Adios,\" with its rapid-fire piano minimalism, seems to contain all of Clementine's vocal personalities as he soulfully opens up his lungs in the verses, only to half-bark the choruses before inserting a rambling spoken word rant about angels midway through. There's no shortage of standouts, with \"London\" and the skittering cabaret of \"Nemesis\" among the album's best moments. The stark, melodramatic \"Cornerstone,\" a centerpiece of his first EP, makes another appearance here to great effect. At Least for Now is a pop record of sorts, but completely on his own terms, and like Antony Hegarty (an acknowledged influence) and Rufus Wainwright, two artists who have similar aspirations of pseudo-classical grandeur, Clementine will no doubt be polarizing for many listeners. There is no question, however, of his raw talent, poeticism, and knack for beguiling melodies, and in this oversaturated market, the true mavericks will always rise above the din. [At Least for Now was also released on LP.] ~ Timothy Monger",

The band worked with producer Peter Katis (known for his work with big names like Interpol and the National) at his Tarquin Studios in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Together the band and Katis crafted the anthemnic and empowering emotional landscapes of the self-titled album, finding a sonic middle ground between the soul-searching epics of U2 circa The Joshua Tree and more contemporary reference points, like the impassioned croon of Bon Iver or Mumford & Sons. ~ Fred Thomas",

        "summary": "Kurt Vile scored a genuine word-of-mouth hit with his fifth album, Wakin on a Pretty Daze, its elongated rambles conjuring hazy half-memories of Laurel Canyon while feeling uniquely situated to modern confines. B'lieve I'm Goin Down..., released two years after that 2013 breakthrough, whittles away some of the excesses while retaining eccentricity, trading ten-minute sprawls with six-strings for woozy five-minute vamps on a piano. Electric guitars aren't entirely absent but they're used for coloring -- arriving unexpectedly as a wash of distortion or perhaps a bit of percussion -- on a record anchored by acoustic guitars and banjos. Such instruments may suggest B'lieve I'm Goin Down... is an exercise in introspection, another exposed nerve from a sensitive singer/songwriter, but Vile often favors feel over form, so this unfolds with the logic of a dream, details falling into a place so subtly they're felt, not heard. Often, B'lieve seems simple, rolling along with fingerpicked rhythms or barroom piano, and while it's certainly emotionally direct -- and, occasionally, musically direct too, nowhere more so than on the opening sequence of \"Pretty Pimpin,\" \"I'm an Outlaw,\" and \"Dust Bunnies,\" a trilogy of precision that eases into a shifting stoned daydream -- B'lieve I'm Goin Down... is an impeccably arranged album beneath its soothing, sleepy surface, with every element assisting in an illusion of deep, shimmering, and alluring melancholy. [An LP version added five extra tracks: \"Less Talk (More Walkin' Away,\" \"Nicotine Blues,\" \"Bad Omens (No Faders),\" \"No Stranger to the Ball Bust,\" and \"Sax Omens (J Turbo).\"] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "English folk revivalists Mumford & Sons' 2009 debut, Sigh No More, boarded the slowest train it could find on its journey from regional gem to pleasantly surprising, international success story. After simmering and stewing throughout the U.K. and Europe, the band landed boots first at the Staples Center for a rousing performance at the 2011 Grammy Awards that found the smartly dressed quartet tearing through \"The Cave,\" and then backing, along with the equally snappy Avett Brothers, Bob Dylan on a generation-spanning rendition of \"Maggie's Farm\" that provided one of the better Grammy moments of the last decade or so. They may lack the lyrical prowess of \"The Bard,\" but they know how to turn a phrase, plant a seed, and build a bridge and tear it back down again without losing the audience in the process. Simply put, they can bend the relative simplicity of traditional folk music to their collective wills, which is exactly what they do on their sophomore outing, Babel. It's also exactly what they did on their debut, and short of being a little rowdier and raspier, Babel feels less like a legitimate sequel and more like an expanded edition of the former. Working once again with producer Markus Dravs, who helmed Arcade Fire's Grammy-winning opus The Suburbs, the Mumford boys have crafted another set of incredibly spirited songs that bark much louder than they bite. Ballsy, pained, fiery, and fraught with near constant references to sin, salvation, and all of the pontifical hopes and doubts that lie between, most of Babel is caught between the confessional and an apocalyptic hootenanny, delivering its everyman message with the kind of calculated spiritual fervor that comes from having to adapt to the festival masses as opposed to the smaller club crowds. Tracks like \"Hopeless Wanderer,\" \"Broken Crown,\" and the vivacious title cut bristle with moxie and self-importance, but feel like a ruse, aiming for the parking lot with the kind of generic, turgid melodrama that always overshoots its mark, leaving another smoky hole in an already pockmarked landscape. It's a shame because there's some potential here, especially when the group eases back on the Me Street Band histrionics. Two albums in and Mumford & Sons still sound like a band fused to the starting block, paralyzed by the thought of having to truly race for their lives. ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "Arguably the most influential live reggae album ever, Babylon by Bus captures Bob Marley and the Wailers during the European leg of their Kaya tour in the spring of 1978. The success of this set was not entirely unexpected, however. If the universal and widespread acclaim of Live! -- their first concert recording -- was an indicator, all involved knew that a Bob Marley & the Wailers performance contained unique energies and a vibe all of its own. Sharply contrasting the somewhat pastoral grooves of the Kaya album, Babylon by Bus possesses a more aggressive sound -- which was a trademark of this particular band. Tyrone Downie's progressive rock keyboard flavors on \"Exodus,\" as well his judiciously located percussive clavinet accentuations during \"Punky Reggae Party,\" lock in with Aston \"Familyman\" Barrett's viscous basslines to create something akin to psychedelic reggae or even along the lines of Parliament/Funkadelic. Likewise, \"Heathen\" highlights Anderson's explosive guitar leads, which are distinctly reminiscent of Eddie Hazel from his early days with Funkadelic. The lead guitar solos on \"Rebel Music (3 O' Clock Roadblock)\" and \"Is This Love\" also define Al Anderson's innovative and decidedly Western guitar style, as it is seamlessly and thoroughly integrated with Marley and the Wailers. As with their first concert album, Babylon by Bus highlights material from the band's history up to that point. \"No More Trouble\" is placed in an entirely new context when linked with \"War,\" which features lyrics taken from a United Nations speech given by Haille Selassie I, the Ethiopian emperor considered the father of modern Rastafarianism. Other early tracks, such as \"Kinky Reggae\" and \"Stir It Up,\" prove to be not the only favorites of concert attendees. More recent offerings of \"Is This Love,\" \"Jammin',\" and \"Exodus\" actually garner the most audible support. Without question, Babylon by Bus is an integral component of any popular music collection. ~ Lindsay Planer",

        "summary": "Electronic music ordinances decree Babylon Rewound a \"remix collection,\" but the eight-track set has a lot in common with traditional Jamaican dub albums as it stretches out the tunes from the Richest Man in Babylon album to their laziest and druggiest potential. Problem is, these so-so tunes don't really deserve this treatment, but they're actually improved by all the wandering, since Thievery Corporation are groovier remixers than most. Groovier than Kid Loco -- judging from his smooth jazzing and unnecessary take on \"Until the Morning\" -- but not as cool as Voidd, who adds a light house touch to \"Un Simple Histoire,\" the highlight by far. Getting lost in Thievery Corporation's dubby remixes is easy, since lazier and looser are qualities their buttoned-up Richest Man could have benefited from. The crooked path the new, reggae-drenched track \"Truth and Rights\" takes suggests even they're aware of the need to loosen the tie, but it fades right as it catches fire, pulling its punch. Still, there's more sensi and less sensibility than usual, which makes Babylon Rewound necessary for fans and worth checking for dabblers. ~ David Jeffries",

        "summary": "The story of Back to Black is one in which celebrity and the potential of commercial success threaten to ruin Amy Winehouse, since the same insouciance and playfulness that made her sound so special when she debuted could easily have been whitewashed right out of existence for this breakout record. (That fact may help to explain why fans were so scared by press allegations that Winehouse had deliberately lost weight in order to present a slimmer appearance.) Although Back to Black does see her deserting jazz and wholly embracing contemporary R&B, all the best parts of her musical character emerge intact, and actually, are all the better for the transformation from jazz vocalist to soul siren. With producer Salaam Remi returning from Frank, plus the welcome addition of Mark Ronson (fresh off successes producing for Christina Aguilera and Robbie Williams), Back to Black has a similar sound to Frank but much more flair and spark to it. Winehouse was inspired by girl group soul of the '60s, and fortunately Ronson and Remi are two of the most facile and organic R&B producers active. (They certainly know how to evoke the era too; Remi's \"Tears Dry on Their Own\" is a sparkling homage to the Motown chestnut \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough,\" and Ronson summons a host of Brill Building touchstones on his tracks.) As before, Winehouse writes all of the songs from her experiences, most of which involve the occasionally riotous and often bittersweet vagaries of love. Also in similar fashion to Frank, her eye for details and her way of relating them are delightful. She states her case against \"Rehab\" on the knockout first single with some great lines: \"They tried to make me go to rehab I won't go go go, I'd rather be at home with Ray\" (Charles, that is). As often as not, though, the songs on Back to Black are universal, songs that anyone, even Joss Stone, could take to the top of the charts, such as \"Love Is a Losing Game\" or the title song (\"We only said good bye with words, I died a hundred times/You go back to her, and I go back to black\"). ~ John Bush",

        "summary": "Bad Blood reveals that Bastille is a synth-driven band that isn't particularly arty, something of a rarity during the electronic pop revival of the 2000s and 2010s. Where many of their contemporaries used the glamour of synth-pop's '80s heyday and electronic music's infinite possibilities to craft shiny pop fantasies, Bastille builds on the glossy, anthemic approach they set forth on the Laura Palmer EP (the title track, which is included here, might also be the least arty song inspired by David Lynch's surreal soap opera Twin Peaks). Early highlights like \"Pompeii,\" \"These Streets,\" and the title track boast panoramic choruses and sleek arrangements that hint at a kinship with Empire of the Sun and Delphic, while the handclaps and popping bassline on the otherwise moody \"Icarus\" recall Hot Chip at their most confessional. However, most of Bad Blood suggests that Bastille are actually an electronically enhanced upgrade of sweeping British pop traditionalists like Keane or Coldplay. The band updates \"Oblivion\"'s piano balladry with ping-ponging drums and contrasts Dan Smith's throaty singing and searching lyrics (\"There's a hole in my soul/Can you fill it?\") with a tumbling  beat on \"Flaws.\" Like the aforementioned acts, Bastille has a way with heartfelt melodies and choruses that resonate, particularly on the driving \"Things We Lost in the Fire\" and \"Get Home,\" where the slightly processed vocals also evoke Sia, Imogen Heap, and other electronic-friendly singer/songwriters. While the band occasionally gets a little too self-serious on the album's second half, Bad Blood is a solid, polished debut that fans of acts like Snow Patrol (who don't mind more electronics in the mix) might appreciate more than synth-pop aficionados. [A digital download added a second set of 13 tracks.] ~ Heather Phares",

        "parentTitle": "Bad Company",
        "summary": "From the wreckage of Free came Bad Company, a group fronted by singer Paul Rodgers and featuring his drummer bandmate Simon Kirke, Mott the Hoople guitarist Mick Ralphs, and King Crimson bassist Boz Burrell. The latter is something of a ringer, suggesting an undercurrent of adventure in the band, but as the group's eponymous 1974 debut decidedly proves, the band is proudly not progressive. If anything, Bad Company excise the excesses of Free -- there are no winding jams and very little added color by way of pianos or even air in the production; those two tricks are evident on their title track/rallying call \"Bad Company,\" and the details make a difference, as do the pastoral acoustics of the closing \"Seagull\" -- reducing their rock & roll to a strong, heavy crunch; compare \"Ready for Love,\" a tune Ralphs brought over from Mott the Hoople, to the original to see how these quartet members keep their heads down as they do their business. Appropriately enough given their name, there's a sense of slow, churning menace to Bad Company. Even the quickest songs -- the blues boogies of \"Can't Get Enough\" and \"Movin' On\" -- don't exactly proceed at a rapid clip, a steadiness that makes the quartet seem heavier. It's hard rock painted in stark black & white: cranked guitars mirrored by a deliberate wallop from the rhythm section, a rock & roll so loud and basic it wound up not aging much at all even though it pretty much defined mid-'70s album rock. [The Rhino 2015 reissue greatly expands the original album by adding a second disc with 13 bonus tracks, including demos, alternate takes, single edits, and two non-LP B-sides. Much of this consists of rougher, longer alternate mixes and demos, but the non-LP \"Little Miss Fortune\" and \"Easy on My Soul\" are also here, both cut from the same cloth as the album but lighter in tone (and in the case of \"Easy on My Soul,\" slightly quicker in step). The most interesting alternate is a \"Hammond Mix\" of \"Can't Get Enough,\" which not only has organ but a guitar army out of Jimmy Page, and that just proves that the minimalist heavy rock of the finished album was very much intentional.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Bad Girls marked the high-water mark in Donna Summer's career, spending six weeks at number one, going double platinum, and spinning off four Top 40 singles, including the chart-topping title song and \"Hot Stuff,\" which sold two million copies each, and the million-selling, number two hit \"Dim All the Lights.\" Producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte recognized that disco was going in different directions by the late '70s, and they gave the leadoff one-two punch of \"Hot Stuff\" and \"Bad Girls\" a rock edge derived from new wave. The original two-LP set was divided into four musically consistent sides, with the rock-steady beat of the first side giving way to a more traditional disco sound on the second side, followed by a third side of ballads and a fourth side with a more electronic, synthesizer-driven sound that recalled Summer's 1977 hit \"I Feel Love.\" Though remembered for its hits, the album had depth and consistency, concluding with \"Sunset People,\" one of Summer's best album-only tracks. The result was the artistic and commercial peak of her career and, arguably, of disco itself. This two-CD reissue fits the original album on disc one with a sole bonus track, Summer's original demo of \"Bad Girls.\" Disc two, dubbed \"12\" Singles & More,\" presents extended dance remixes of Summer hits from \"I Feel Love\" to the post-Bad Girls numbers \"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\" (a duet with Barbra Streisand) and \"On the Radio,\" including versions of all four Bad Girls hits (the fourth being \"Walk Away\"). The packaging re-creates the expensive, glossy cover of the original LP, with Summer as a scantily clad streetwalker. The choices to augment the album are excellent, giving a good sense of Summer in her 1977-1980 prime. ~ William Ruhlmann",

Furthermore, the music on Bad Hair Day not only lacks the humor, it lacks the impish energy that made Weird Al's first albums such fun. If you find \"Amish Paradise\" funny, chances are you'll be more satisfied by a single than the album.

        "parentTitle": "Bahamas",
        "summary": "Bahamas' third studio album, 2014's Bahamas Is Afie, finds lead singer/songwriter Afie Jurvanen once again guiding his folk-inflected Canadian indie outfit through a handful of his own introspective yet melodically enticing songs. Produced by Jurvanen with help from Robbie Lackritz (who produced 2012's Barchords), Bahamas Is Afie is a measured, organic album largely centered around Jurvanen's burnished, laconically soulful voice. Jurvanen, with his penchant for yearning, rootsy songs full of twangy guitars and poignant lyrics, often brings to mind both Canadian singer/songwriter Ron Sexsmith and American Blue Note artist Amos Lee. Which isn't to say that Jurvanen doesn't have his own, beautifully layered, longing pop sound. On the contrary, cuts like the opening \"Waves,\" with its jazzy strummed guitar and languid, summer-sad melody, and \"Stronger Than That,\" with its soulful guitar lines and gospel-tinged backing vocals, are immediately memorable songs that get to the root of what makes Bahamas' sound so engaging. Elsewhere, Jurvanen delves into several bittersweet acoustic numbers (\"Can't Take You with Me,\" \"Nothing to Me Now\"), as well as a few '70s soft country-sounding songs (\"Half Mine,\" \"Little Record Girl\"). Along with superbly crafted material, Jurvanen often dresses his songs with light horn and string adornments that complement his more direct country and rock sensibilities. There is a warmth, joyfulness, and sly humor to Bahamas' sound here that keeps you listening even when Jurvanen turns toward melancholy sentiments, as he often does. Ultimately, it's that juxtaposition of front-porch balladry, lyrical intimacy, and urbane studio savvy that makes Bahamas Is Afie so unforgettable. As Jurvanen opines on \"All the Time,\" \"I got all the time in the world/Don't you want some of that?\" ~ Matt Collar",

        "summary": "Joy Williams and John Paul White arenât a couple, but they certainly sound like theyâre in love, singing together with the sort of familiarity that only seems to exist between couples and siblings. On Barton Hollow, their studio debut as the Civil Wars, the two trace each otherâs melodies with close harmonies that never fail to lose their romance, even on breakup tunes like âFalling.â Itâs an organic, folk-pop sound not unlike the one made by the Swell Season, another boy/girl duo with a talent for making heartbreaking Americana. If the Civil Wars are Americaâs answer to that band, then âPoison & Wineâ is their âFalling Slowly.â An aching, gorgeous tribute to a relationship on the rocks, itâs one of the few tracks to include more than an acoustic guitar, with some piano and soft drums also making their way into the mix. Even so, the focus remains on the bandâs vocals, which are easily the best instruments on Barton Hollow. Those who donât like rootsy ballads are in for some slim pickings, since Barton Hollow shines its brightest whenever the tempos slow, the lights dim, and the voices rise up. But the title track, with its outlaw lyrics and swanky Southern groove, is a nice change from the norm, and âIâve Got This Friendâ finds a balance between both camps. Good stuff. [Barton Hollow was also released with six bonus tracks.] ~ Andrew Leahey",

        "summary": "There is no other album like Bat Out of Hell, unless you want to count the sequel. This is Grand Guignol pop -- epic, gothic, operatic, and silly, and it's appealing because of all of this. Jim Steinman was a composer without peer, simply because nobody else wanted to make mini-epics like this. And there never could have been a singer more suited for his compositions than Meat Loaf, a singer partial to bombast, albeit shaded bombast. The compositions are staggeringly ridiculous, yet Meat Loaf finds the emotional core in each song, bringing true heartbreak to \"Two out of Three Ain't Bad\" and sly humor to \"Paradise by the Dashboard Light.\" There's no discounting the production of Todd Rundgren, either, who gives Steinman's self-styled grandiosity a production that's staggeringly big but never overwhelming and always alluring. While the sentiments are deliberately adolescent and filled with jokes and exaggerated clichÃ©s, there's real (albeit silly) wit behind these compositions, not just in the lyrics but in the music, which is a savvy blend of oldies pastiche, show tunes, prog rock, Springsteen-esque narratives, and blistering hard rock (thereby sounding a bit like an extension of Rocky Horror Picture Show, which brought Meat Loaf to the national stage). It may be easy to dismiss this as ridiculous, but there's real style and craft here and its kitsch is intentional. It may elevate adolescent passion to operatic dimensions, and that's certainly silly, but it's hard not to marvel at the skill behind this grandly silly, irresistible album. [A Super Audio Hybrid CD version of Bat Out of Hell was released in 2015.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "As rock music moved forward in new and unexpected directions in the latter part of the '60s, no band merged the virtues of past and present as well as Creedence Clearwater Revival. The group clearly drew from the classic sounds of blues, R&B, rockabilly, and swamp rock, but they played with an energy and imagination that was entirely up to date, and they were one of the few bands who could dive into an extended jam on occasion while still understanding the beauty of the three-minute single. And the group's leader, John Fogerty, was one of the finest American songwriters to emerge in the second half of the '60s, building on classic American archetypes while expressing the rage and tumult of his times. Between 1968 and 1972, the prolific group released seven studio albums, and The 40th Anniversary Editions Box Set features all of them, presented complete and with bonus tracks, documenting the full arc of Creedence Clearwater Revival's remarkable career. Albums included are Creedence Clearwater Revival (1968), Bayou Country (1969), Green River (1969), Willy and the Poor Boys (1969), Cosmo's Factory (1970), Pendulum (1970), and Mardi Gras (1972). ~ Mark Deming",

        "summary": "Following the release of their 2013 debut, Curiosity, Portland-based duo Wampire had to adapt to a rigorous touring schedule, as well as expand their membership from the long-running creative team of songwriters/multi-instrumentalists Rocky Tinder and Eric Phipps to a full band that could bring its studio creations to life on-stage. Curiosity was a busy and hyper-saturated pastiche of retro reference points and furry psych pop. It was a fantastically groomed album but also one that was years in the making, pained over by Tinder and Phipps as their band played locally around Portland, chipping away at ever-incubating ideas with no record deadline hovering over them. The intensive touring that followed the album's release can be heard in the overall sound of Bazaar. The album is dark and haunted, with the same sense of paranoia that touched Curiosity, but even with production handled again by Unknown Mortal Orchestra's Jacob Portrait, the songs sound more live, visceral in a way that comes when a band graduates from low-key house parties close to home to nightly international touring. While Tinder and Phipps wrote and performed Curiosity entirely as a duo, they let touring drummer Thomas Hoganson into the fold this time around, offering his various talents as a player and songwriter to the moody tones of Bazaar. Hoganson's saxophone playing becomes the unexpected star of almost every song he unleashes it on. He trades zippy sax lines with wobbly, '70s-sounding synth leads on standout track \"Wizard Staff,\" the bandmembers sounding like less hyperactive, more meticulous cousins of their retro-minded peers in Foxygen. With the burning fuzz-fest opening track \"The Amazing Heart Attack,\" they also tap into the heavier side of classic rock borrowing of bands like Tame Impala and (going further back) Dungen in their early days, and switch gears into soft vocal harmonies and nostalgic psych on \"Millennials\" or vaguely country-tinged soft rock tenderness with \"Life of Luxury.\" All captured directly to warm analog tape, Bazaar sounds less constructed than its predecessor, even as the band zigzags through various styles and experiments with arrangements. The combination makes for a more direct delivery of some of their strongest songs and improves on the debut by stripping away some of its clutter. ~ Fred Thomas",

        "summary": "When the Hotel CafÃ© became a nationally recognized launching pad for songwriters in 2008, Ingrid Michaelson stood out amongst artists who regularly played the venue, flaunting a confident sound that was a cut above the average female crooner. Her second indie album, Girls and Boys, made waves one year prior when it topped some digital charts, eventually selling over 740,000 copies of its lead single thanks to licensing deals with Old Navy and Grey's Anatomy. Released in 2008, Be OK continues her Norah Jones-gone-pop approach with 11 tracks. This isn't a proper studio effort -- rather, it's a benefit project (with proceeds going to cancer research) that takes its material from live performances, rarities, and several new tracks. Filled with handclaps and breezy guitar chords, the titular \"Be OK\" bookends the set list with two different versions -- one filled with harmonies, keyboards, and percussion, and the other sticking closer to an acoustic arrangement. Michaelson's voice is strong enough to carry those tracks alone, but her melodies sound strongest when flanked by harmonies, whether they're provided by the singer's own double-tracked voice or contributions from her touring bandmates. \"The Chain,\" a longtime live favorite and perhaps the best song on this disc, even careens into a three-person round, utilizing the harmony approach better than any Michaelson track since \"The Way I Am.\" She leads the pack, advising her ex-lover to \"glide away on soapy heels\" while her melodies are echoed by Bess Rogers and Allie Moss. It's a simple song, but its presentation makes all the difference -- a telltale sign of a songwriter who knows how to breathe new life into a veteran genre. ~ Andrew Leahey",

        "summary": "One of Gilberto's less impressive '60s Verve outings, primarily due to the more pop-oriented song selection. Much of this is just standard pleasant Gilberto: offhand vocals and a sumptuous Brazil pop-cum-U.S. orchestration feel (Ron Carter and Toots Thielemans are among the sidemen). And some of the pop choices work well, particularly Tim Hardin's gorgeous \"Misty Roses.\" No vocals or arrangements, however, could save the criminally wrong-headed military march of \"A Banda (Parade),\" or the exasperatingly coochie-coochie duet between Gilberto and her six-year-old son on the Lovin' Spoonful's \"You Didn't Have to Be So Nice.\" Which makes it all the more surprising when the next and concluding track, \"Nao Bate O Corocao,\" has Gilberto cutting loose with confident, sassy scats, as she rarely did before or since. The CD reissue improves matters by adding five bonus cuts from A Certain Smile a Certain Sadness, recorded in 1966 in more authentically bossa nova-style arrangements, anchored by organist Walter Wanderley. ~ Richie Unterberger",

        "summary": "Like the long, cold prairie winters during which it was recorded, Andy Shauf's sophomore LP, The Bearer of Bad News, is both grim and beautiful, bearing the kind of weary warmth of a bedroom lamp lit after a five p.m. sunset. Recorded in his basement in Regina, Saskatchewan over the course of two years and written over four, it has the deep, refined feeling of being worked on, but not overworked. The 11 tracks here are decidedly rustic at heart, with a hushed, Spartan feeling akin to early Elliott Smith albums, an acknowledged influence of Shauf's. The vision is singular, with Shauf supplying all the vocals and instrumentation save for drums on one track. From the dead-string strumming of the buoyant opener \"Hometown Hero\" to the foreboding creep of \"Wendell Walker,\" he paints a descriptive picture of small-town life and lonesome folks looking inward with desolate lines like \"Now this past winter was the coldest in years/It's hard to explain if you've never lived here.\" Shauf's brand of Canadiana is rooted in folk music, but the sophistication of his arrangements reveals a keen pop sensibility that saves it from wallowing too deeply in the sepia-toned doldrums. His clever and often dissonant clarinet and string orchestrations on songs like \"I'm Not Falling Asleep\" and \"The Man on Stage\" add a richness of color that belies the album's generally somber tone. The Bearer of Bad News may be a sad, introspective album, but Shauf's lyrical poeticism and multidimensional musicality are what sets it apart from others of its ilk. ~ Timothy Monger",

        "summary": "James Taylor never sets his guitar down -- he spends a good portion of every year satisfying faithful audiences -- but he did rest his pen, opting to sit out the 13 years following the release of 2002's October Road. He kept busy with covers albums and Christmas records, but Before This World finds Taylor returning to writing, a habit he abandoned about a decade prior. Often, Before This World contains echoes of the first decade of the new millennium -- there is a passing reference to 9/11 in a song about Afghanistan and a love letter to the Boston Red Sox's 2004 World Series win -- but Taylor wrote these all in a batch, then recorded them at home with his touring band. Such quick progress gives the record a cozy, unified feeling but, unlike some latter-day JT records, it's not too comfortable. Taylor is randy enough to sing about some \"first-class poontang\" on the nicely grooving \"Stretch of the Highway,\" a song more notable for a mellow vamp worthy of Steely Dan, the first suggestion there's a bit more variety here than on a typical Taylor platter. He'll ease into his trademark laid-back pop, opening the proceedings with \"Today Today Today\" and brightening up the midsection with the happy \"Watchin' Over Me,\" but as the record comes toward its conclusion, he takes detours into traditional English folk on \"Before This World/Jolly Springtime\" and \"Wild Mountain Thyme,\" while etching out a cinematic protest song in \"Far Afghanistan.\" When a record runs only ten tracks and 41 minutes, these departures amount to nearly half the record and turn Before This World into something unexpected: a record as relaxed as the average James Taylor album but one that's also riskier and richer, the right album for him to make at this date. [Before This World was also released on LP.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Irish singer and songwriter SOAK begins her debut album with the words \"A teenage heart/Is an unguided dart,\" and she ought to know -- SOAK (real name Bridie Monds-Watson) was just 18 years old when Before We Forgot How to Dream was released. And it's not especially hard to guess her age while listening to these songs: SOAK sounds and writes like a teenager, in the best of all possible ways, full of confidence that wrestles with a certain natural hesitance, and not the least bit afraid to wear her heart on her sleeve. SOAK's lyrical approach sometimes borders on melodrama, but it's an honest, thoroughly genuine melodrama that speaks of a time in life when so many moments seem like they're a matter of life and death. In her quiet but forceful manner, SOAK is remarkably eloquent on this album, though the childlike timber of her vocals and her strong Irish accent mean some listeners will have to judge her intent from tone rather than the literal meaning of the lyrics, at least on first listen. Producer Tommy McLaughlin has the good sense not to fancy up these songs too much -- while there are effective and atmospheric washes of keys, percussion, and strings on Before We Forgot How to Dream, the principal focus is always on SOAK's vocals and guitar, and the spare, echoey sound of the album gives the songs weight without robbing them of their intimacy (though the three brief passages of sculpted noises could probably be lost without hurting the album in any appreciable way). SOAK's youth is so much a virtue on Before We Forgot How to Dream that one wonders how much her music will change when she hits her twenties and sees the world after a few concert tours, but there's a lot of very real talent on display here, and it's fortunate that she's been captured for the ages while she's still fresh and her voice remains unique and very much her own. ~ Mark Deming",

        "summary": "In L.A.âs pop music scene, the influence of Fleetwood Mac is rarely more than a vocal harmony away. Itâs uncommonly (but not offensively) close on Belle Brigadeâs debut, a collection of sunny pop songs that take their cues from the âCalifornia soundâ of yesteryear. Fronted by the brother/sister combo Ethan and Barbara Gruska, the group blows through 11 tunes in an economical 39 minutes, evoking everyone from CSNY to Linda Ronstadt along the way. The siblings harmonize the way family members often do, flanking each otherâs melodies during the verses and double-tracking their voices into thick chords during the choruses. With help from a rotating roster of backup musicians -- mostly Barbaraâs cohorts from her days as a touring drummer for Inara George and Jenny Lewis -- the siblings cast a wide net, riding a country-rock groove on âMy Goodnessâ and resurrecting the breezy charm of Rumours-era Lindsey Buckingham on âWhere Not to Look for Freedomâ before drifting into the Los Angeles smog with the albumâs hazy closer, âFasten You to Me.â Like Jenny and Johnny, another SoCal harmony duo, they rarely sing without the other personâs help, and this pastoral pop record sparkles whenever the two lock together in close harmony. ~ Andrew Leahey",

        "summary": "Specializing in a cinematic spectacle that evokes wide-open vistas as much as the fathomless depths of an arena, Of Monsters and Men sometimes do sound as majestic as their dreams on Beneath the Skin, pulsating on the waves of insistent rhythms and armies of acoustics. Such a description suggests they hew closely to the Mumford & Sons stomp -- and that does surface occasionally, usually as a forgotten memory, not a rhythm; it's a counterpoint, not a focus -- but the sextet prefers the operatic bombast of Arcade Fire. Where Win Butler and comrades prefer to address big issues with their big music, Of Monsters and Men turn inward, marrying their soundscapes to tales of introspection and romance. The thing is, it doesn't quite matter precisely what Of Monsters and Men sing about on Beneath the Skin. Many of the songs are sturdy, constructed to support these grand ambitions, but these individual pieces are not as consequential as the big, big picture. No, what matters is that gigantic, sparkling rush, a sound that seems destined to fill a vast, empty sky. That they never succeed at their goal is secondary: what lasts is the vision and vibe, an atmosphere that resonates long after the album concludes.

        "summary": "As soon as Benjamin Booker's eponymous 2014 debut kicks in with a skittish guitar run and a primal garage beat, it's clear the guitarist -- a native of Tampa Bay who spent time in New Orleans before heading back to Florida -- is unapologetic for the debt he owes to Jack White. Like the Black Keys and Gary Clark, Jr. before him, Booker revels in gnarly guitar skronk, pushing the all-natural fuzz to the forefront -- lessons perhaps learned from Jack White, but Booker distinguishes himself from the pack by adding a bit of swing and boogie to the raw roar. Where Clark, Jr. is a bit of an old-fashioned guitar hero, slipping into a bit of slickness on his 2012 major-label debut Blak and Blu, Booker enjoys every ragged edge. This is readily apparent on the punky thrashers -- including \"Violent Shiver,\" which opens the album with a jolt, as well as \"Old Hearts\" -- but also evident on such spacy, open-ended ballads as \"I Thought I Heard You Screaming,\" the full-tilt boogie of \"Chippewa,\" and sunbaked crawl of \"Spoon Out My Eyeballs,\" which apart from its violent title could be mistaken for forgotten slice of '60s soul. Some of this bracing rawness is due to producer Andrija Tokic, who chose to keep things loud and disjointed (it's the opposite of his carefully tailored work for the Alabama Shakes), but it also suits Booker's spirit. Raised on rock, both classic and punk, as well as blues, Booker has no tidy set of influences and prefers to celebrate the grey areas and intense mess of the 21st century, and that blurred, boundless enthusiasm makes Benjamin Booker one hell of a debut. [Benjamin Booker  was also released on LP.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "This 22-cut double-disc set finally gets at it. Issuing a single disc of Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler would be a silly thing at best and a hopelessly frustrating one at worst. When the band burst on the scene with \"Sultans of Swing,\" there was a lot happening in rock music, but most of it was under the radar and remains forgotten except in the historic annals of music fanatics. Knopfler and his band were full of rock & roll romance and proved it through their first four recordings time and again. They couldn't help but become superstars and mainstays of MTV. But there is another story told on this best-of, which begins with \"Telegraph Road.\" The story-songs Knopfler wrote were always the best anyway, and this set is full of them, from \"Sultans\" to \"Romeo & Juliet,\" \"Skateaway,\" \"So Far Away,\" \"Walk of Life,\" and (of course) \"Brothers in Arms,\" which made for the most dramatic marriage of the little screen and rock music when it was featured in the closing sequence of an episode of Miami Vice. But there are many other stops along the way, like \"Private Investigations,\" \"Sailing to Philadelphia,\" \"Going Home\" (from Local Hero), and \"The Long Road\" (from Cal). But \"On Every Street,\" \"Calling Elvis,\" and \"What It Is\" are here, too, making for a wonderfully rounded if argumentative best-of collection that goes the distance and explains sonically what all the fuss was about in the first place. There's the guitar sound that's as much Tony Joe White as it is J.J. Cale and Billy Gibbons, and the elegance of James Burton and Chet Atkins. There is soul, pathos, drama, and a bittersweet memory that Van Morrison first evoked on Astral Weeks and Saint Dominic's Preview. There is a new cut here as well, a duet with Emmylou Harris called \"All the Roadrunning,\" taken from an upcoming collaborative album, and it's nice -- beautiful, in fact -- and keeps the line of continuity and excellence in perspective. This is not only a fine collection for fans because of its wonderful sequencing, but the best introduction to the man and the band that one could ask for. ~ Thom Jurek",

        "summary": "For years, Kevin Spacey's dream project was a biopic on '60s crooner Bobby Darin, starring himself as the lead. After over a decade of struggling to get it made, he finally got a green light in the early 2000s to start production, not just as the lead actor, but as the director and producer of Beyond the Sea. One of Spacey's key decisions in the film was to use newly recorded music for the soundtrack, and for him to sing in character as Darin. This is an unquestionable act of either courage or chutzpah, but Spacey had skills to back it up. In fact, part of the reason he was able to get the project off the ground was that he made a public display of his singing when he belted out a powerful \"Mind Games\" when he MCed a 2001 John Lennon tribute concert, a move that illustrated his roots in musical theater and paved the way to Beyond the Sea. That musical theater background is still evident on the soundtrack, where Spacey's occasionally mannered performances bear the inflections of somebody singing for stage, not record. Instead of hurting the album, it's part of what makes the whole exercise somewhat fascinating. With the assistance of producer Phil Ramone, Spacey has carefully captured the spirit of Darin's original recordings, sometimes duplicating arrangements, other times altering them slightly (\"Dream Lover\" no longer has the appealingly heavy-handed strings that punctuated the chorus). The album emphasizes Darin's big-band crooning, but touches on his Brill Building rock & roll and folk material as well, offering a good cross section of his music. While a hits collection would be a better introduction for a neophyte, this is a good listen in its own right, particularly because there is real passion behind Spacey's go-for-broke, splashy performances. It doesn't make it better than Darin's recordings, but it makes Beyond the Sea an inspired listen, and a satisfying one as well. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "OutKast's first hits compilation comes at the perfect time; after gaining millions of new fans (more of a whole different demographic) with the crossover hit Stankonia, DrÃ© and Big Boi delivered a tight summation of their decade-long career for listeners whose familiarity grows hazy before the duo hit with \"Ms. Jackson\" and \"B.O.B.\" OutKast has been doing great work since their fully formed debut with 1993's \"Player's Ball,\" and their singles hold up well. Those looking for positivity and emotion on the level of \"Ms. Jackson\" will find it (wrapped in great productions) on \"Rosa Parks\" and \"Git up, Git Out.\" The down-tempo \"Elevators (Me & You)\" is an OutKast history-in-miniature, while two excellent tracks from their debut -- \"Ain't No Thang\" and \"Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik\" -- introduced the group's formula of syrupy G-funk and intricate, slang-heavy rapping. Also included are three new tracks: the brass-heavy \"Funkin' Around,\" a P-Funk pastiche named \"The Whole World,\" and the jazz-club jam \"Movin' Cool (The After Party).\" [Big Bio & Dr. Dre Present... was also released in a clean version.] ~ John Bush",

        "summary": "Austin-based singer/songwriter Kat Edmonson has built a cult following around her cherubic, jazz-inflected songs. And while she has always utilized the colorful harmonies and clever lyrical melodies of jazz and American popular song, at her core she's a jazz-influenced pop artist, and this album finds her embracing those sensibilities more than ever. If Edmonson's 2012 sophomore album, Way Down Low, found her moving even further afield from the cabaret jazz of 2009's Take to the Sky, then 2014's The Big Picture reveals another evolution toward an all-original approach to making music. Working with producer Mitchell Froom, Edmonson wrote and/or co-wrote all of the songs on The Big Picture. Froom, no stranger to the art of presenting quirky singer/songwriters, having worked with such similarly inclined artists as Ron Sexsmith, Crowded House, Suzanne Vega, and others, is the perfect collaborator for Edmonson. Here, he frames her lilting, Billie Holiday-meets-Blossom Dearie vocals with the kind of '50s and '60s traditional pop sound that Edmonson lightly flirted with on Way Down Low. However, on The Big Picture the singer truly makes this style her own. There is a charming, vintage vibe to many of the album's tracks, with Froom and Edmonson striking a nice balance between cuts that have a retro, orchestral AM pop sound, such as the swinging ballad \"Oh My Love,\" and a more contemporary folk sound, as on the poignant \"All the Way.\" Elsewhere, Edmonson delves into Ennio Morricone spaghetti Western drama (\"You Can't Break My Heart\"), breezy '60s lounge music (\"Avion\"), and Brill Building echo-chamber romanticism (\"For Two\"). Ultimately, by bringing all of her influences together with Froom's help, Edmonson's own unmistakable sound comes into fine focus on The Big Picture. ~ Matt Collar",

        "summary": "This is quite a package, but one that makes little sense in a way. As a way of clearing inventory, Sony/BMG has been assembling five-album sets, calling the entire series Original Album Classics. Simply put, they pack five albums in sequence and reissue them. In the case of Hall & Oates, they don't follow a strict in-sequence release pattern, instead picking five hit albums. This starts with the self-titled album and Bigger Than Both of Us, but then jumps right to Beauty on a Back Street and leaves out Along the Red Ledge, then goes back to order with Private Eyes, leaving out Voices and X-Static. It also includes H2O. This is all well and good but doesn't really fill a void, and anyone who collects Hall & Oates material already has most if not all of these albums. The price point isn't terribly attractive either -- they are standard budget-line prices without a discount for the quantity. ~ Thom Jurek",

        "summary": "This collection of 78 rpm singles, all recorded on June 6, 1950, was released in 1956. Several things distinguish this from numerous other quintet recordings featuring these two bebop pioneers. It was recorded during the period that Parker was working under the aegis of producer Norman Granz, whose preference for large and unusual ensembles was notorious. The end result in this case is a date that sounds very much like those that Parker and Gillespie recorded for Savoy and Dial, except with top-of-the-line production quality. Even more interesting, though, is Parker's choice of Thelonious Monk as pianist. Unfortunately, Monk is buried in the mix and gets very little solo space, so his highly idiosyncratic genius doesn't get much exposure here. Still, this is an outstanding album -- there are fine versions of Parker standards like \"Leap Frog,\" \"Mohawk,\" and \"Relaxin' with Lee,\" as well as a burning performance of \"Bloomdido\" and twjo interesting (if not entirely thrilling) renditions of the chestnut \"My Melancholy Baby.\" ~ Rick Anderson",

        "summary": "The Black Dirt Sessions, Deer Tickâs third full studio album, combines the easy balladry and boozy rock tunes of the bandâs prior two releases, but does away with the old-timey blues and country influences. The new sound of the group, which includes new member Ian Oâ Neil of Titus Andronicus on guitar, is contemporary and sincere. Vocalist John McCauley, the chief songwriter of the group, seems to have found his own distinct voice and is comfortable reeling back and singing quietly, harnessing his muscular, grainy timbre into a sweet instrument. The first half of the album never breaks a sweat, concentrating solely on stripped-down, melancholy ballads. Side two breaks away from the acoustic aspects, and kicks up a laid-back Nashville groove with honky tonk piano, Stonesy guitar riffs, and classic Americana harmonies. McCauley sounds liberated, calling up â70s hooks and harmonies that feel classic without being overtly retro. For The Black Dirt Sessions, the sepia tones are faded and less distracting. Songs written to sound like old pub standards helped to gain the group attention, but these heartfelt tunes gleam with McCauleyâs individuality. ~ Jason Lymangrover",

        "summary": "With Black Hours, frontman Hamilton Leithauser became the second member of the Walkmen to surface with new music during the band's \"extreme hiatus\" (the first being Walter Martin with his charming children's album We're All Young Together). It's often difficult for lead singers to make a break from their previous work since they're such a defining force in a band's sound. Leithauser happens to be one of indie rock's most distinctive vocalists, as well as one of the most versatile; the way he switched from a Dylanesque sneer, a Bono-like wail, or a Sinatra-worthy croon made him an invaluable part of the Walkmen's fiery yet reflective music. Perhaps it's not surprising, then, that Black Hours feels more like an extension of his work with that band than a drastic departure from it. Leithauser puts the album's biggest surprise first: \"5 A.M.,\" a fabulous ballad inspired by Sinatra classics such as In the Wee Small Hours, dives into throaty, string-laden drama without ever seeming too theatrical. It's a bold start, and a somewhat misleading one; the rest of Black Hours expands on the Walkmen's legacy in more familiar ways. \"St. Mary's County,\" a collaboration with bandmate Paul Maroon (who also provided many of the album's string and horn arrangements), is the kind of dreamy, drifting ballad that populated latter-day albums like You & Me. Conversely, \"Alexandra\" and \"I Don't Need Anyone\" are brash, swaggering, and secretly vulnerable standouts that also remain well within the Walkmen's wheelhouse. The older-and-wiser feel of the band's gorgeous maybe-swan song Heaven continues on \"The Smallest Splinter,\" which finds Leithauser just as dramatic and demanding running toward love as running away from it, and on \"I Retired,\" where lyrics like \"No one knows what I was fighting for/I don't even know myself anymore\" can't help but feel like a response to the fury of songs such as \"The Rat.\" Black Hours' most intriguing moments make the most use of the orchestral touches that set the album apart from Leithauser's previous work, whether it's the marimba on \"The Silent Orchestra\" or the beautiful \"Self-Pity,\" which combines one of his finest vocal performances yet with graceful strings and moody, Stones-y rock. It would be unfair to call Black Hours a missed opportunity; even if its glimpses at fresher musical territory are tantalizing, Leithauser carries on the Walkmen's tradition in ways that fans will welcome. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "After being dropped by Capitol, Jimmy Eat World returned in 2001 with their most consistent and accessible album to date. Recorded entirely on the band's dime before they had a new record deal, Bleed American features compelling lyrics, driving guitar work, and insanely catchy melodies. Left to their own devices during the recording process, it wouldn't have been surprising if the band had turned out another layered, sprawling album akin to their previous full-length masterwork, Clarity. Perhaps sensing that they wouldn't be able to top their previous work when it came to spacy emo, Bleed American heads in a new direction. There are no 16-minute songs here, just straight-ahead rock & roll, performed with punk energy and alt-rock smarts. The title track sets the tone for the album with its blistering guitar attack and aggressive vocals. \"A Praise Chorus\" and \"The Middle improve upon that formula, maintaining the forceful instrumentation but toying with the lyrical themes. \"A Praise Chorus\" uses the most basic of rock emotions for lyrical inspiration, \"I wanna fall in love tonight,\" while lifting lyrics from Tommy James' \"Crimson and Clover,\" They Might Be Giants' \"Don't Let's Start,\" and MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e's \"Kick Start My Heart,\" among others. When used in a song about the comfort and trappings of nostalgia, this borrowing comes off more like a well-placed tribute than stealing. \"The Middle\" offers a pep talk about self-acceptance and fitting in, and one of the most memorable guitar riffs this side of Angus Young. Bleed American's quieter moments recall some of the band's signature instrumentation from their previous work. Gentle keyboards, bells, and stirring background vocals from former that dog. member Rachel Haden enhance the understated beauty of ballads like \"Hear You Me\" and \"Cautioneers.\" Haden's most enjoyable contribution, however, is to the up-tempo rocker \"The Authority Song.\" On the surface a song about a song (John Mellencamp's \"Authority Song), it also name drops the Beatles' \"What Goes On.\" The numerous references to other bands and other songs reveal that although Jimmy Eat World is a critically acclaimed and incredibly talented band, the members are really just rock fans themselves. If they maintain this level of quality, however, don't be surprised if the next generation of ambitious rockers start writing songs that pay tribute to Jimmy Eat World. [Bleed American was re-released on LP in 2015.] ~ Mark Vanderhoff",

        "summary": "Having formed on the spur of the moment for a local Battle of the Bands contest, New South Wales quartet Cloud Control certainly appear to have extolled the virtues of spontaneity after recently winning the Australian Music Prize for their debut album, Bliss Release. As its title suggests, its ten tracks are a tour de force in psychedelic dream pop whose warm, lush harmonies, chilled-out vibes, and organic production from Belles Will Ring's Liam Judson are perfectly suited for a drive along the coastlines of the Blue Mountain-area, where the band originates. Opener \"Meditation Song #2 (Why Oh Why)\" blends Fleet Foxes-esque pastoral folk with distorted guitar riffs and handclapped rhythms, and Alister Wright and Heidi Lenffer's ethereal dual vocals to produce a glorious blast of sun-soaked, '60s-tinged pop. Equally mystical is the jangly indie pop of \"There's Nothing in the Water We Can't Fight,\" an enchanting ode to the Hindu God of Water, inspired by an excursion to India; the thumping kick drums and post-punk melodies of the meditative \"Ghost Story,\" and the languid MGMT-ish prog rock leanings of \"The Rolling Stones.\" But the follow-up to their 2008 self-titled EP also occasionally throws in some other world influences to complement its otherworldly state of mind, as on the likes of \"Gold Canary,\" whose groove-laden Afro-beat owes a nod to the band they've recently supported, Vampire Weekend, while the gorgeously tender Grizzly Bear-style acoustic ballads \"Hollow Drums\" and \"Just for Now\" offer a respite for anyone overwhelmed by its overriding sense of hippie chic. Bliss Release is perhaps a little too derivative to justify the classic status it's been afforded in the band's homeland, but it's still a delightfully charming debut, made even more impressive by their hastily assembled beginnings. ~ Jon O'Brien",

        "summary": "Following on the heels of an album where he repudiated his past with his greatest backing band, Blood on the Tracks finds Bob Dylan, in a way, retreating to the past, recording a largely quiet, acoustic-based album. But this is hardly nostalgia -- this is the sound of an artist returning to his strengths, what feels most familiar, as he accepts a traumatic situation, namely the breakdown of his marriage. This is an album alternately bitter, sorrowful, regretful, and peaceful, easily the closest he ever came to wearing his emotions on his sleeve. That's not to say that it's an explicitly confessional record, since many songs are riddles or allegories, yet the warmth of the music makes it feel that way. The original version of the album was even quieter -- first takes of \"Idiot Wind\" and \"Tangled Up in Blue,\" available on The Bootleg Series, Vols. 1-3, are hushed and quiet (excised verses are quoted in the liner notes, but not heard on the record) -- but Blood on the Tracks remains an intimate, revealing affair since these harsher takes let his anger surface the way his sadness does elsewhere. As such, it's an affecting, unbearably poignant record, not because it's a glimpse into his soul, but because the songs are remarkably clear-eyed and sentimental, lovely and melancholy at once. And, in a way, it's best that he was backed with studio musicians here, since the professional, understated backing lets the songs and emotion stand at the forefront. Dylan made albums more influential than this, but he never made one better. [In 2003, Columbia/Legacy reissued 15 selected titles from Dylan's catalog as hybrid SACDs, playable in both regular CD players and Super Audio CD players. Each title is packaged as a digipak, containing the full original artwork. On each of the titles, and on each of the layers, the remastered sound is spectacular, a considerable upgrade from the initial CD pressings. Blood on the Tracks was one of five titles that also included a 5.1 Surround Sound mix.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Blue Film, Matthew Hemerlein's intense, intimate debut album as Lo-Fang, was inspired by a mixtape, and the free-flowing blend of sounds on these songs retains some of that feel. Encompassing R&B, synth pop, orchestral, and folk music -- sometimes within the same song -- Hemerlein loves and excels at striking juxtapositions. He makes ukulele and heavy synth bass sound not just natural but seductive on the album's title track, and peppers the set with string-laden interludes that reflect his classical training. Blue Film expands on Lo-Fang's singles, which are still highlights: \"Look Away\"'s claustrophobic voyeurism morphs from sleek to earthy to refined effortlessly, setting the tone for the rest of the album; \"#88,\" a symphonic, seven-minute epic, is even more ambitious. Meanwhile, the bubbling, R&B-inspired \"Light Year\" and \"Animal Urges,\" which boasts a chorus that could grace a Top 40 hit, only feel like singles. Hemerlein uses the rest of Blue Film to expand on his songwriting voice, which is just as unique as the way he combines sounds. True to the album's title, Hemerlein doesn't shy away from the more lurid side of human nature. His songs often reside in unsettling grey areas, whether it's the obsessions of \"Confusing Happiness\" (\"I can dream you in detail\") or the distance that can creep into even the most intimate moments on \"When We're Fire.\" However, Blue Film's most striking example of this might be a cover: Lo-Fang's version of \"Boris,\" first done by the female singer/songwriter duo BOY, may be more disturbing than the original; having a man sing the predatory come-ons that inspired the song in the first place blurs the lines between flirting and harassment even more chillingly. As dark as the album gets, Hemerlein manages to preserve the humanity of his songs -- there's a warmth to his voice and a brightness to his music that makes the disturbing places he explores a little more relatable. Blue Film's other cover, a somber rendition of the Grease favorite \"You're the One That I Want,\" narrowly avoids parody and serves as a reminder that there's a fine line between ambition and indulgence. Even so, Blue Film is an often unforgettable introduction. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "Elvis movies never came bigger than Blue Hawaii, the 1961 romantic musical comedy whose success helped push Presley into near full-time filmmaking for the bulk of the '60s. Not only was the flick a hit but so was the soundtrack, going Gold by the end of 1961, a success partially fueled by the ballad \"Can't Help Falling in Love,\" a song so good it suggests the rest of the record might contain other gems. That's not the case. The record has its moments, including the dreamy title track, but as an album, Blue Hawaii is undone by a film that demands a good chunk of its tunes carry a Hawaiian flavor. Often, this mid-century Polynesian exotica has its charms -- Elvis croons sweetly on the swaying luaus and everybody involved has the good sense to embrace the project's inherent silliness, letting themselves josh around on deliberate fluff like \"Rock-A-Hula Baby\" and the vaudevillian rhumba that's \"Beach Boy Blues.\" Both of these are ridiculous but on record, they're slightly preferable to the steady march of island tunes (\"Aloha Oe,\" \"Ku-U-I-Po,\" \"Island of Love,\" \"Hawaiian Love Song\"), all silver screen corn performed with a bit more panache than they deserve. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

The Australian band had finally broken through with their previous record, Diesel and Dust, but chart accomplishments didn't temper the group. Blue Sky Mining found lead singer Peter Garrett and the boys singing about familiar themes with their usual passion. The songs aren't quite on par with those from Diesel and Dust, but there's still enough here to make it a worthy follow-up. The lead track \"Blue Sky Mine\" deals with the oppression of the lower working class within the context of a mining company. The immediately catchy cut managed to find mid-chart success. Other notable tracks are the driving \"Forgotten Years,\" which also managed a bit of airplay, and the menacing \"Mountains of Burma.\" The band stumble only once, on the clumsy love song \"Shakers and Movers.\" [A remastered, limited edition of Blue Sky Mining was released in 2014.] ~ Tom Demalon",

        "summary": "Comic actors John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd received a lot of flak for their Blues Brothers shtick -- mostly for the albums, not 1980's beloved classic film. But they should be given credit for exposing many people -- including this reviewer -- to the music of blues and R&B veterans. The Blues Brothers soundtrack was released on Atlantic Records. On the surface this doesn't seem unusual, since the Blues Brothers' Atlantic debut, Briefcase Full of Blues, was a number one album; but the movie was released by Universal, and its parent company, MCA, passed on the soundtrack. The rollicking remake of the Spencer Davis Group's \"Gimme Some Lovin'\" was a hit, featuring an arrangement notable for the horn section that replaces Steve Winwood's rumbling organ work. Ray Charles has a good time with \"Shake a Tail Feather,\" and he's helped out by Jake and Elwood Blues (Belushi and Aykroyd, respectively). The cover of Solomon Burke's \"Everybody Needs Somebody to Love\" is a lot of fun, thanks to the great overall rhythm and Elwood's lightning-fast stage rap, while James Brown and the Reverend James Cleveland Choir provide a blast of gospel music on \"Old Landmark.\" Aretha Franklin's \"Think\" is explosive, and Cab Calloway's \"Minnie the Moocher\" is slyly irresistible. Charles, Brown, Franklin, and Calloway all have small roles in the film, yet so does John Lee Hooker, but he's not represented here. ~ Bret Adams",

Instead of asking a single producer to harness their unusually diverse sound -- which mixes rap, rock, emo, electronic, and even reggae -- they've collaborated with a variety of different producers (Ricky Reed, Mike Crossey, and Tim Anderson, among others) and studios, introducing a number of new sounds, styles, and textures into their already heady mix. Since their early days building a grassroots following on the Midwestern college town music circuit, Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun have never short-changed their aspirations, and as they come off their most successful period yet, their upward trajectory appears to continue on the ambitious Blurryface.

        "parentTitle": "Bon Iver",
        "summary": "Part of the beauty of Bon Iverâs debut album, For Emma, Forever Ago, was the intimate, backwoods feel of the recording and the simplicity of Justin Vernonâs soaring, open wound of a voice with only minimal musical backing to distract from its impact. Even though Vernon had a few other people playing on the album, it was easy to imagine a solitary broken soul spilling his guts onto tape for hours at a time while the world went on without him. It was a truly aching, somewhat claustrophobic sound that was beautiful and unique. After a couple years in which his life was basically turned upside down thanks to the success of For Emma, Vernonâs second album is quite different. Where For Emma was stripped down and intimate, Bon Iver is packed with guest musicians, horn sections, strings, and extra vocalists. Every inch of sonic space is filled with sound, each one fighting for space and distracting from Bon Iverâs strength, namely Vernonâs vocals. Itâs probably unfair to expect Vernon to replicate the sound of For Emma, but he could have found a middle ground between tender restraint and totally overdoing it. Instead, heâs working like mad to distance himself from the sound he established so well in a desperate attempt to make a âmasterpieceâ instead of For Emma, Pt. 2. Perhaps if he were a more skilled producer and arranger, things would have been better. Unfortunately, his style comes off more like sub-Enya with a beard than a true studio wizard. The muted, over-washed sound of the record is murky when it should be mysterious, flat when it should be 3-D, and his reliance on clichÃ©d synth sounds is somewhat perplexing. Pity he didnât call up his buddy Kanye for some tips. While most of the record is underwhelming sonically, the last track, \"Beth/Rest,\" is laughable. Sounding like it was recorded using a five-dollar Casio and featuring some of the worst dueling sax/guitar solos youâd ever imagine, it shoots for a majestic, album-ending feel but instead sounds like the theme song to a horrible '80s movie about unicorns (only not that good). Despite disasters like that, there are still enough moments of tender beauty and restraint to remind you why Bon Iver is worth caring about. The relatively restrained \"Wash,\" which pits Vernonâs aching vocal orchestra against a jagged, repeating piano line (and only minimal strings and pedal steel), the first two-thirds of \"Holocene\" (before the mix bursts with saxes and unnecessary effects), the simple and affecting \"Michicant\" (if you can ignore the distractions) -- these have hints of the grace and understated emotion that made For Emma what it was. Hints arenât enough to make the record a success, though, and by reaching too far, Vernon and Bon Iver fall flat with a huge thud. Itâs a shame Vernon felt he had to take Bon Iver outside the cabin and into the world. He was doing just fine on his own and didnât need all those people and instruments cluttering up the air. âWoodsâ proved that all Vernon needed to break a heart was his voice and some Auto-Tune. Though he can be praised for not just copying himself and trying to progress, to be honest, For Emma, Pt. 2 would have been far more satisfying than this overblown debacle. ~ Tim Sendra",

        "summary": "Few American acts reflected the mindset of the '60s as well as Simon & Garfunkel. In 1964, the duo released their first album, Wednesday Morning, 3 AM, which sounded like an echo of the Greenwich Village folk scene that was quickly fading from relevance. But when producer Tom Wilson overdubbed a rock & roll rhythm section on one of the album's tunes, \"The Sound of Silence,\" it became a belated hit single, and Simon & Garfunkel quickly evolved into one of the leading lights of the folk-rock movement, performing timely and literate songs (largely written by Simon) that examined the personal and universal issues of the day, wrapped in artful arrangements and splendid harmonies by the two lead singers. And as the promise of the early '60s gave way to the malaise of the end of the decade, Simon & Garfunkel gave America a song of solace in \"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" which became one of the most covered songs of the '70s. The Complete Columbia Albums Collection is a six-LP vinyl box set that includes the five studio albums Simon & Garfunkel cut during their original run -- 1964's Wednesday Morning, 3 AM, 1966's Sounds of Silence and Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme, 1968's Bookends, and 1970's Bridge Over Troubled Water -- as well as the 1972 compilation Simon & Garfunkel's Greatest Hits, which includes some non-LP singles and otherwise unavailable live performances. While this isn't the complete Simon & Garfunkel catalog, it's close to it, and this set presents the duo's original albums in the format and sequence in which they were intended to be heard; for audiophiles with a fondness for vinyl, The Complete Columbia Album Collection presents an important body of work in impressive form, and as both music and pop-culture history, these albums are little short of essential. ~ Mark Deming",

It may have string quartet instrumentation and the elegant style of classical music, but the similarities end there. Born is first and foremost a dance album, with electronic club beats pushing the musicians' alternately majestic and ethereal melodies into the realm of dancefloor dramatics. Worldbeat influences are an important component of Bond's sound, with bits of Middle Eastern, Celtic, and Southern/Eastern European folk musics popping up on various tracks. However, appropriated classical themes and a movie soundtrack feel (often courtesy of film composer Magnus Fiennes) predominate. Classical fans will either find this watered down or a great way to hook younger listeners (though that logic is somewhat debatable, since they wouldn't really be listening to classical music in all its complexity); it's probably best to take Born simply for what it aspires to be -- exotic and melodic dance music for a non-purist audience. ~ Steve Huey",

That the witless wonders of the Reagan regime attempted to co-opt the title track as an election-year campaign song wasn't so surprising: the verses described the disenfranchisement of a lower-class Vietnam vet, and the chorus was intended to be angry, but it came off as anthemic. Then, too, Springsteen had softened his message with nostalgia and sentimentality, and those are always crowd-pleasers. \"Glory Days\" may have employed Springsteen's trademark disaffection, yet it came across as a couch potato's drunken lament. But more than anything else, Born in the U.S.A. marked the first time that Springsteen's characters really seemed to relish the fight and to have something to fight for. They were not defeated (\"No Surrender\"), and they had friendship (\"Bobby Jean\") and family (\"My Hometown\") to defend. The restless hero of \"Dancing in the Dark\" even pledged himself in the face of futility, and for Springsteen, that was a step. The \"romantic young boys\" of his first two albums, chastened by \"the working life\" encountered on his third, fourth, and fifth albums and having faced the despair of his sixth, were still alive on this, his seventh, with their sense of humor and their determination intact. Born in the U.S.A. was their apotheosis, the place where they renewed their commitment and where Springsteen remembered that he was a rock & roll star, which is how a vastly increased public was happy to treat him. [Born in the U.S.A. was re-released on CD in 2015.] ~ William Ruhlmann",

        "summary": "Boston is one of the best-selling albums of all time, and deservedly so. Because of the rise of disco and punk, FM rock radio seemed all but dead until the rise of acts like Boston, Tom Petty, and Bruce Springsteen. Nearly every song on Boston's debut album could still be heard on classic rock radio decades later due to the strong vocals of Brad Delp and unique guitar sound of Tom Scholz. Tom Scholz, who wrote most of the songs, was a studio wizard and used self-designed equipment such as 12-track recording devices to come up with an anthemic \"arena rock\" sound before the term was even coined. The sound was hard rock, but the layered melodies and harmonics reveal the work of a master craftsman. While much has been written about the sound of the album, the lyrics are often overlooked. There are songs about their rise from a bar band (\"Rock and Roll Band\") as well as fond remembrances of summers gone by (\"More Than a Feeling\"). Boston is essential for any fan of classic rock, and the album marks the re-emergence of the genre in the 1970s. [Boston was re-released on LP in 2010.] ~ Vik Iyengar",

        "summary": "This box set containing the remastered, expanded editions of all five of Simon & Garfunkel's original LPs on five CDs just -- but only just -- misses a top rating, by virtue of its packaging. The sound is, as with the individual editions of each title, a significant improvement over any prior releases of this material and proves to be utterly impeccable, and the annotated booklet, containing the original credits and notes off the albums as well as the lyrics and all of the new annotation for each individual album by Bud Scoppa, is fairly handy. The problem is the packaging of the individual discs in miniature recreations of the original LP jackets, which are somewhat awkwardly stowed in one side of the box interior -- unless they're lined up perfectly, however, they will come out of that receptacle; additionally, as there are no inner sleeves for the CDs in their miniature jackets (a necessity and a courtesy provided by the Japanese when they issue CDs in miniature LP sleeves), it's easy for them to slide out of their jackets and get scratched and dinged even prior to purchase and opening. It's a shame that Columbia went to this kind of trouble in remastering and preparing this edition without seeing to such obvious details, and the result is a 50 dollar box set that is more inconvenient than it needed to have been. ~ Bruce Eder",

        "parentTitle": "Tiny Ruins",
        "summary": "Since her haunting 2011 debut as Tiny Ruins, New Zealand singer/songwriter Hollie Fullbrook has toured the world, earned considerable critical success, and expanded her quiet folk project into a trio. After an EP of demos in 2013, Fullbrook, along with bassist Cass Basil and drummer Alexander Freer, signed with Britain's Bella Union label and recorded their follow-up, 2014's gently austere Brightly Painted One. The expansion of the band and subsequent move to a larger record label have affected Tiny Ruins only in the subtlest of ways. The hushed introspection and heavy British folk influences remain at the core of her sound as Fullbrook continues to channel her inner Vashti Bunyan and Nick Drake throughout the album's 11 songs. Recorded in Auckland by engineer Tom Healy, Brightly Painted One features a richer and deeper sonic palette with Fullbrook's lightly picked guitar still at the core, but sparingly ornamented with organ, brass, and string flourishes on lovely ballads such as \"She'll Be Coming Round\" and \"Straw Into Gold.\" Other tracks, like the enchanting opener \"Me at the Museum, You in the Wintergardens\" and the wistful \"Chainmail Maker,\" are even more understated, focusing generally on just the core acoustic trio and Fullbrook's alluringly sad voice. It's a beautiful album, but one so deliberately eschewing all modern conveniences and casting itself so wholly in a far-distant past of hazy English Sundays that if it weren't for the quality of the band's work, it might come off as slightly too contrived. As it is, though, Brightly Painted One sounds more like a loving tribute to a simpler, slower time and once decanted, the songs begin to take on a personality of their own. [Brightly Painted One was also released on LP.] ~ Timothy Monger",

        "summary": "If Teleman's debut album, Breakfast, found Thomas and Jonny Sanders and Pete Cattermoul branching out after their time in Pete & the Pirates, then Brilliant Sanity is all about refinement. Working with producer Dan Carey, the men of Teleman (who also include drummer Hiro Amamiya) focused Breakfast's airy pop and chugging rock into songs that are honed, but not necessarily tamed. The results are quirky yet classic-sounding English guitar pop full of a nervy essence and hooks that sneak up on listeners' ears and refuse to leave. On songs like the wonderfully insistent \"Superglue,\" Thomas Sanders sounds equally detached and emotional as he sings about the eternal tug-of-war between freedom and constraints that defines relationships -- and pop music. \"Glory Hallelujah\"'s \"happy ever after\" feels both genuine and ironic, while \"Drop Out\" stealthily cuts all ties, its lengthy bridge capturing the giddy rush of escaping the gravity of commitment. A similar weightlessness animates \"English Architecture\"'s sweet ambivalence, \"Melrose\"'s levitating synths, and \"Tangerine\"'s psychedelic synth pop daydreams, but the sense of loss -- or something missing -- gives this drift a surprising amount of purpose. Once again, Brilliant Sanity's sharpened songwriting lets its haunting mood cut more deeply, with odd yet potent motifs (glue, shoes, flickering lights) guiding Teleman's meditations on permanence and impermanence. The times the band addresses these feelings directly make for some of the album's most affecting moments: \"DÃ¼sseldorf\"'s melting ice, grey towns, and disappearing girls linger in the memory longer than might be expected, while \"Fall in Time\"'s battle between intimacy and fear is both eerie and earnest. While Breakfast's amiable ambling is sometimes missed -- \"Canvas Shoe\" is the closest this album comes to it -- it's hard to deny that Teleman's hard work paid off: Brilliant Sanity's musings on uncertainty are some of their most confident songs yet. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "Retreating from the hazy Danger Mouse-fueled pot dream of Attack & Release, the Black Keys headed down to the legendary Muscle Shoals, recording their third album on their own and dubbing it Brothers. The studio, not to mention the artwork patterned after such disregarded Chess psychedelic-era relics as This Is Howlinâ Wolfâs New Album, are good indications that the tough blues band of the Black Keys earliest records is back, but the group hasnât forgotten what theyâve learned in their inwardly psychedelic mid-period. Brothers still can get mighty trippy -- the swirling chintzy organ that circles âThe Only One,â the Baroque harpsichord flair of âToo Afraid to Love Youâ -- but the album is built with blood and dirt, so its wilder moments remain gritty without being earthbound. Sonically, that scuffed-up spaciness -- the open air created by the fuzz guitars and phasing, analog keyboards, and cavernous drums -- is considerably appealing, but the Black Keys' ace in the hole remains the exceptional songwriting that Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney are so good at. They twist a Gary Glitter stomp into swamp fuzz blues, steal a title from Archie Bell & the Drells but never reference that classic Tighten Up groove, and approximate a slow â60s soul crawl on âUnknown Brotherâ before following it up with a version of Jerry Butlerâs âNever Gonna Give You Up,â and itâs nearly impossible to tell which is the cover. And thatâs the great thing about the Black Keys in general and Brothers in particular: the past and present intermingle so thoroughly that they blur, yet thereâs no affect, just three hundred pounds of joy.

        "summary": "The band themselves were displeased with this record, feeling that the production did not capture their on-stage energy and excitement. Yet to most ears, this debut sounds pretty great, featuring some of their most melodic and accomplished songwriting and harmonies, delivered with a hard-rocking punch. \"For What It's Worth\" was the hit single, but there are several other equally stunning treasures. Stephen Stills' \"Go and Say Goodbye\" was a pioneering country-rock fusion; his \"Sit Down I Think I Love You\" was the band at their poppiest and most early Beatlesque; and his \"Everybody's Wrong\" and \"Pay the Price\" were tough rockers. Although Neil Young has only two lead vocals on the record (Richie Furay sang three other Young compositions), he's already a songwriter of great talent and enigmatic lyricism, particularly on \"Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing,\" \"Out of My Mind,\" and \"Flying on the Ground Is Wrong.\" The entire album bursts with thrilling guitar and vocal interplay, with a bright exuberance that would tone down considerably by their second record. [Some reissues present both mono and stereo mixes of the album, and include \"Baby Don't Scold Me\" (which was on the first pressing of the record, but was soon replaced by \"For What It's Worth\").] ~ Richie Unterberger",

        "summary": "In 1982, the unexpected success of the Stray Cats' American debut, Built for Speed, made America aware that rockabilly, previously believed to be extinct, was actually alive and well somewhere in New Jersey (though the evidence had to be taken to England before anyone would notice). Pulling together six songs from the Stray Cats' self-titled debut, five tunes from the follow-up Gonna Ball, and one previously unreleased number (the title song), Built for Speed is song-for-song the group's strongest album, despite the cut-and-paste manner in which it was created. Originality was never this band's strongest suit, and as songwriters the Stray Cats rarely wandered far from the traditional themes of cars, girls, rockin', and their own level of coolness, but Brian Setzer's fleet-fingered guitar work revealed that he'd absorbed the lessons of Cliff Gallup, James Burton, and Scotty Moore and constructed an impressive and colorful style of his own from the parts, while Lee Rocker and Slim Jim Phantom were an admirably potent and appropriately uncluttered rhythm section (the clean, streamlined production, by Dave Edmunds on most cuts, also helped quite a bit). If the group's songs haven't all worn the test of time especially well, the melodies are strong and the playing is tight and enthusiastic throughout. While you're better off with a good collection from Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, or Charlie Feathers, there are a lot worse ways you could learn about rockabilly than to pick up Built for Speed -- which is a good thing, since if you were born after 1965, chances are it was where you learned about rockabilly. ~ Mark Deming",

        "summary": "Seeing as how his come-up number was a trip-hop cover of \"No Diggity\" and his name is a Kurt Vile-like play on jazz great Chet Baker, Australian electronica producer Nick Murphy aka Chet Faker arrives with two overly clever strikes against him, at least on the surface. Tricky thing is, those who dig into that Blackstreet cover finds themselves enveloped in a warm, soulful slinker of the highest order, but the even better news is that Built on Glass is a rich debut, falling between the two hypotheticals of a James Blake record inspired by joy or a Beck album that should be filed under the category of \"earnest.\" The lyrics offer a lazy fascination with subjects like love, loss, and afternoons off, while swaying tempos support sounds like bubbling house music, jazzy, Joe Pass-like guitar passages, and Faker's warm vocals, which are as if Eddie Vedder were born a slow soul man. The great \"Talk Is Cheap\" is broken beat house with a wonderful Boz Scaggs feel, while \"Cigarettes & Loneliness\" is a compositional triumph with interwoven guitars and Faker's lovelorn singing holding the listener's hand as a whirling dervish develops on a rainy Sunday. The volume is only pumped up to a Derrick May or Carl Craig level as highlight \"1998\" bubbles with that Detroit techno feel, and yet sticking with subdued suits the artist at this point. Built on Glass isn't so much limited as it is a wonderful mood piece, so think calm and cool with purpose, and then get hip to the restrained and resonating sound of Faker. ~ David Jeffries",

The remaining three tracks (\"Electric Love,\" \"Past Lives,\" and \"Seeing Stars\") follow suit, offering up immaculately produced earworms that are as dreamy as they are immediate and hook-laden. ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "The Doobie Brothers' third long-player was the charm, their most substantial and consistent album to date, and one that rode the charts for a year. It was also a study in contrasts, Tom Johnston's harder-edged, bolder rocking numbers balanced by Patrick Simmons' more laid-back country-rock ballad style. The leadoff track, Johnston's \"Natural Thing,\" melded the two, opening with interlocking guitars and showcasing the band's exquisite soaring harmonies around a beautiful melody, all wrapped up in a midtempo beat -- the result was somewhere midway between Allman Brothers-style virtuosity and Eagles/Crosby & Nash-type lyricism, which defined this period in the Doobies' history and gave them a well-deserved lock on the top of the charts. Next up was the punchy, catchy \"Long Train Runnin',\" a piece they'd been playing for years as an instrumental -- a reluctant Johnston was persuaded by producer Ted Templeman to write lyrics to it and record the song, and the resulting track became the group's next hit. The slashing, fast-tempo \"China Grove\" and \"Without You\" represented the harder side of the Doobies' sound, and were juxtaposed with Simmons' romantic country-rock ballads \"Clear as the Driven Snow,\" and \"South City Midnight Lady.\" Simmons also showed off his louder side with \"Evil Woman,\" while Johnston showed his more reflective side with \"Dark Eyed Cajun Woman,\" \"Ukiah\" and \"The Captain and Me\" -- the latter, a soaring rocker clocking in at nearly five minutes, features radiant guitars and harmonies, soaring ever higher and faster to a triumphant finish. ~ Bruce Eder",

        "summary": "Settle was an unqualified success. Platinum, number one, and nominated for a Mercury Prize in Disclosure's native U.K., it was also Grammy-nominated in the U.S. \"Latch,\" the album's propellant, primed vocalist Sam Smith for stardom. The Lawrence brothers subsequently worked with Nile Rodgers and Mary J. Blige, remixed Usher's \"Good Kisser,\" and released a pair of club tracks that, more than anything else, showed that fame wasn't stalling their productivity. In May 2015, the garage-flavored \"Holding On\" -- co-written by Jimmy Napes, a contributor to the debut's three biggest hits -- appeared as the first proper single from the second Disclosure album. It neatly integrated additional songwriting input and a lead from Blue Note jazz vocalist Gregory Porter and, like much of what preceded it, was swift and full of friction yet measured and tasteful. Inferior second pre-album single \"Omen\" outperformed it, most likely because it featured Smith. The contrast between those two singles is a running theme on Caracal, where tracks featuring lower-profile vocalists regularly upstage those fronted by chart-topping stars. Smith, Lorde, Miguel, and the Weeknd provide the album with a lot of star power, not much else. The last-mentioned contributor, for instance, opens the album by singing 100% \"on-brand\" lyrics that seem generated rather than written -- so much so that they can be summarized as \"vampire Weeknd\" -- albeit with a thrown-in reference to the wild cat that inspired the album's title. The Lawrences' taste in upcoming talent and ability to assimilate it into their sound, however, is faultless. Fellow U.K. natives Kwabs and Nao are responsible for a pair of irrefutable R&B jams, the vocalists' turns recalling, respectively, James \"D Train\" Williams and young Deniece Williams atop some of the producers' most detailed and sumptuous work yet. The lighter cuts, most notably the one that features Lion Babe's Jillian Hervey, tend to stick with as much immediacy, and are as full-bodied as the slower numbers. Although the tracks rarely surprise, frequently falling back on familiar sounds and structures -- loping basslines and synthesizer shadings that escalate at the same tempo always arrive on time, for instance -- they're as well-built as those of the debut, and the Lawrences, along with their songwriting partners, cover the ups and downs of falling in and out of love in sharper fashion. [A digital version added three bonus tracks, \"Molecules,\" Moving Mountains,\" and \"Afterthoughts.] ~ Andy Kellman",

Carlos Santana was obviously very hip to jazz fusion -- something the innovative guitarist provides a generous dose of on the largely instrumental Caravanserai. Whether its approach is jazz-rock or simply rock, this album is consistently inspired and quite adventurous. Full of heartfelt, introspective guitar solos, it lacks the immediacy of Santana or Abraxas. Like the type of jazz that influenced it, this pearl (which marked the beginning of keyboardist/composer Tom Coster's highly beneficial membership in the band) requires a number of listenings in order to be absorbed and fully appreciated. But make no mistake: this is one of Santana's finest accomplishments. ~ Alex Henderson",

        "summary": "Nothing truly prepares anyone for the loss of a parent. No matter how aware one may be about the realities of disease and death, no matter what their attitude about their mother or father, experiencing the passing of the person who brought them into this world hits hard and deep, and the survivors are left to come to terms with their pain in their own ways. Sufjan Stevens is a songwriter and a musician, so it should come as no surprise that in the wake of the death of his mother Carrie in 2012, his grief took the form of a collection of songs. But 2015's Carrie & Lowell is not a simple homage to Stevens' mother and stepfather. Stevens had a difficult relationship with his mother that would defy a simple farewell; she left his father when Stevens was just a year old, and she was a random presence throughout much of his childhood. While there's deep and genuine love in Carrie & Lowell, there's also uncertainty, sadness, and brief but jagged bursts of anger; these songs speak of loss and heartache and the difficult push and pull of familial relationships, but they're also full of random memories, both pleasant and troubling, and they leap from reveries of family vacations faded by the passing of decades, to the immediate regrets of what was or wasn't said and done in the aftermath of death. Carrie & Lowell is about memory as much as mourning, and Stevens has drawn these songs in a purposefully elegant manner, with his introspection accompanied by beautiful but homespun melodies, and the arrangements and production only magnifying their dreamlike, whisper-quiet drift that strikes with an emotional force that a louder, more violent approach could not achieve. Carrie & Lowell is a heartfelt expression of love that is devoid of the slightest hint of sentimentality, and with these songs, Stevens strips his emotions bare and allows us all to be the audience for his anger, shame, and sense of loss as he pages through his memories of his family. Carrie & Lowell is the most harrowingly personal work Stevens has offered us to date; it also ranks with his most skillfully crafted albums despite its spartan approach, and it's a sometimes difficult but profoundly moving work. Stevens has offered us some fine albums in the past, but he's never made anything quite like Carrie & Lowell. ~ Mark Deming",

        "summary": "The Cars' 1978 self-titled debut, issued on the Elektra label, is a genuine rock masterpiece. The band jokingly referred to the album as their \"true greatest-hits album,\" but it's no exaggeration -- all nine tracks are new wave/rock classics, still in rotation on rock radio. Whereas most bands of the late '70s embraced either punk/new wave or hard rock, the Cars were one of the first bands to do the unthinkable -- merge the two styles together. Add to it bandleader/songwriter Ric Ocasek's supreme pop sensibilities, and you had an album that appealed to new wavers, rockers, and Top 40 fans. One of the most popular new wave songs ever, \"Just What I Needed,\" is an obvious highlight, as are such familiar hits as \"Good Times Roll,\" \"My Best Friend's Girl,\" and \"You're All I've Got Tonight.\" But like most consummate rock albums, the lesser-known compositions are just as exhilarating: \"Don't Cha Stop,\" \"Bye Bye Love,\" \"All Mixed Up,\" and \"Moving in Stereo,\" the latter featured as an instrumental during a steamy scene in the popular movie Fast Times at Ridgemont High. With flawless performances, songwriting, and production (courtesy of Queen alumni Roy Thomas Baker), the Cars' debut remains one of rock's all-time classics.

        "summary": "Colin Meloy's dynamic vocals lead the way on Castaways and Cutouts, the impressive 2003 effort by Portland, OR, quintet the Decemberists. Throughout the disc, Meloy's songs tell tales of life's castaways, including Spanish gypsies and Turkish prostitutes, painting glorious pictures with supposedly suspicious characters. After opening the album with two subdued tracks, \"July, July!\" is a lively anthem, setting a gloriously quirky pace for the rest of the disc. \"A Cautionary Song\" centers around Jenny Conlee's accordion, as acoustic guitar swirls around Meloy's narrative. \"Odalisque\" is quite possibly the highlight of the album, carrying the listener through peaks and valleys led by Conlee's juiced-up organ and Meloy's grittiest vocals of the disc. \"Cocoon\" calms the mood back down, with gentle piano and guitar serving as the song's backbone. On \"The Legionnaire's Lament,\" the band's effortless folk is at its best, with choppy guitars and enchanting organ swirling behind Meloy's relentlessly thrilling storytelling. Yet again, the disc continues a rise-and-fall approach as the restrained and engaging \"Clementine\" is next, followed by the beautiful \"California One,\" which features some jaw-dropping upright bass by Nate Query. That song makes a seamless transition into the closer, \"Youth and Beauty Brigade,\" a carefully crafted epic full of witticisms and reserved style. Meloy's vocals are their most engaging by now, and while the last track might not be the standout song of the disc, it's perfectly positioned on the disc for maximum effect. The song's rising intensity and lyrical imagery add up for a stunning finish, leaving the listener clamoring for more, as all great albums do. Chris Funk adds guitar and theremin, and drummer Ezra Holbrook rounds out the five-piece band. Originally released in 2002 on Hush Records, Kill Rock Stars Records released Castaways and Cutouts in May 2003. ~ Stephen Cramer",

        "summary": "Manhattan Records' release of Celtic Woman is a compilation/collaboration between five unknown vocalists, introduced only by their first names (ChloÃ«, Lisa, Ãrla, MÃ©av, and MÃ¡irÃ©ad), who take turns chirping Irish ballads as heard through a dramatic, lush new age filter. Via reverb-heavy and thick keyboard atmospherics, the singers cover contemporary ground, such as Enya's \"Orinoco Flow,\" to traditional melodies like \"Danny Boy\" and \"Ave Maria.\" While each vocalist brings a separate lovely timbre to the table, each song shares a similar theatrical arrangement and plodding tempo that smoothes over any subtleties that might distinguish track from track, therefore fitting well sonically side by side, but leaving the listener yearning for a bit more dynamic. Overall Celtic Woman is a decent set of well-performed vocal pop, but ultimately more a soothing background soundtrack than anything memorable. ~ Gregory McIntosh",

        "summary": "James Bay is a young British singer and songwriter whose heartfelt songs and passionate vocal style suggest a greater maturity and experience than one would expect from an artist whose debut album was released when he was 24 years old. Chaos and the Calm, Bay's first full-length album following a pair of well-received EPs, reveals he has a precocious talent as a songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist, and is just as comfortable with outgoing tracks like \"Collide\" as he is with intimate, personal numbers such as \"Let It Go\" as he winds together elements of pop, folk, rock, blues, and soul. Often compared to Ed Sheeran and Ben Howard, Chaos and the Calm shows James Bay has the style and the ability to stand on his own, and it's the work of a new performer with an impressive potential.

        "parentTitle": "Nico",
        "summary": "Although Chelsea Girl (1967) was the first long-player from the German-born Christa PÃ¤ffgen, it was not her debut solo effort. Prior to becoming involved with the Velvet Underground and while under the direction of Andrew Loog Oldham, Nico issued an obscure 7\" on the mod pop Immediate label. The song selection on that 1965 single -- which featured a cover of Gordon Lightfoot's \"I'm Not Sayin'\" and an Oldham co-composition with Jimmy Page called \"Last Mile\" -- foreshadowed the eclectic nature of this LP. Although the dissolution between the vocalist and core instrumental quartet was not without its share of acrimony, the non-percussive contingent of the Velvet Underground is heavily featured on Chelsea Girl: along with then-unknown singer/songwriter Jackson Browne (guitar) -- the vocalist's concurrent love interest -- there is Lou Reed (guitar), Sterling Morrison (guitar/bass), and John Cale (piano/bass/viola), who contrast what they had been doing with the larger combo. These sides are decidedly \"unplugged,\" providing a folky and Baroque setting for Nico's dark and brooding vocal inflections. There is an introspective foresight in Browne's \"Fairest of the Seasons,\" \"These Days,\" and \"Somewhere There's a Feather.\" The minimalist string section features a quaint, yet effective arrangement giving the material a distinctly European feel. These orchestrated folk leanings are similar to the sound emanating from other burgeoning groups such as the Incredible String Band, Pentangle, and the Fairport Convention spin-off Fotheringay.The same can be said of her almost unrecognizable reworking of Bob Dylan's \"I'll Keep It With Mine.\" The noir black-widow charm ultimately saves the performance, as does Cale's remarkable classical intonations. With Reed's \"Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams\" -- a track which actually predates the Velvet Underground -- there is a sense of history that Nico brings to her interpretation, as if the melody were, in fact, a traditional German folk tune. There is a palpable distinction between those lighter cuts and the menacing Velvet Underground-conceived material. At the center of the project are the extended \"It Was a Pleasure Then\" and the stunning semi-autobiographical Reed/Morrison title track. The juxtaposition of such honest and at times harrowing imagery to Nico's inherently bleak delivery is nothing short of an inspired artistic statement which has since long outlasted its initial socially relevant context -- similar to the more modern contributions of Laurie Anderson, Ann Magnuson, and Patti Smith. An unqualified masterpiece. ~ Lindsay Planer",

        "summary": "Good Charlotte's popularity exploded in 2002, when the brash singles \"Anthem\" and \"Lifestyles of the Rich and the Famous\" catapulted them to the top of the punk-pop heap. Once there they couldn't be stopped, at least in part because they endorsed their pop side as much as their punk-derived image. When naysayers tried pointing out the music's lack of substance, Charlotte's irascible core -- tattooed brothers Benji and Joel Madden -- challenged them with the issue of \"Boys and Girls,\" a vacuous yet irresistibly fizzy new wave-styled goof. Chronicles of Life and Death, Good Charlotte's first post-fame album, uses that status as a loosely binding concept. The Maddens are unquestionably happy with their celebrity. But they've also realized that money won't always buy happiness, or heal their old scars. After an indulgent string section intro, the title track begins to the beep of a heart-rate monitor. \"Money talks/In this world,\" Joel Madden sings the song's modified power pop strut. \"That's what idiots will say/But you'll find out/That this world/Is just an idiot's parade.\" It's the jaded realization on the other side of \"Lifestyles\"' stardom-baiting. Whereas their previous effort was, with a few notable exceptions, boisterous punk-pop, Chronicles includes an echoing relationship-woe piano ballad (\"The Truth\"), the subdued \"Ghost of You\"'s synthesizers and vocal harmonies, and quirky keyboards and acoustic guitars in the lyrically bitter \"The World Is Black\" (\"I can't live when this world keeps dying...\"). Joel Madden has also matured since Young and the Hopeless -- his newly developed husky tenor suits him well on the more introspective material, but can still belt out the rousing punk-pop choruses of \"Walk Away (Maybe),\" \"Predictable,\" and \"Secrets.\" The album's best track might be its greatest departure. \"I Just Wanna Live\" is a punchy blend of power chords, string samples, and disco beats that features Madden rapping in a Nelly-inspired flow. For all their well-crafted ambition on Chronicles, \"I Just Wanna Live\" feels like Good Charlotte's centerpiece, since it's spiked with rock power, but gets its soul from the pop life they lead. [Chronicles of Life and Death was issued in \"Life\" and \"Death\" versions, each with a unique bonus track.] ~ Johnny Loftus",

Management struggles and sundry other hindrances limited his output, but couldn't avert the Scot from releasing two legendary singles -- the Tarantino-ized \"Stuck in the Middle With You\" and the unforgettable \"Baker Street,\" the latter included on this record. Just a glimpse of John Patrick Byrne's cool cover art lets the listener know City to City houses Rafferty's day in the sun as he conquers the world one metropolis at a time, his guitar and amp in tow. Setting out in his apocalyptic \"Ark,\" each song radiates the confidence of a master craftsman cruising in his prime, constructing brilliant pop confections with top-flight support while awaiting the crunch of civilization. The dreamy reality check \"Baker Street\" rightfully remains one of the greatest cuts in pop history. Forever-lost B-side \"Big Change in Weather\" further demonstrates Rafferty was on a rare roll. Domestic valentine \"Right Down the Line\" snugly followed to the height of the charts, and third release, \"Home and Dry,\" while not of an immortal status, stands as a quality song. He even stomps out a smooth hoedown on the title track. Rafferty's turns of phrase and tight composition skills create a fresh sound and perspective all his own. Any diverse style (and he attempts many) filters through his unique mindset, resulting in a classic platter buoyed by many moments of sheer genius. \"Whatever's written in your heart, that's all that matters.\" ~ Doug Stone",

        "summary": "Up until the release of 2011âs album Civilian, the indie rock duo of Wye Oak released two albums and one EP of solid, well-crafted indie rock. Built around the husky vocals and biting guitars of Jenn Wasner and the steady backbeat of Andy Stack, they trod upon familiar ground; writing mysterious and autumnal songs with a melancholy and intimate feel that had loud/quiet dynamics and a homemade sound. Not exactly innovative but delivered with enough passion to make the records keepers. They probably could have kept along the same path and cranked out a few more albums before people got tired of them, and indeed, Civilian does hew closely to the template theyâve already created. This time, however, something seems different. The albums sounds brighter and better recorded, Wasner's songs are crisper and more memorable with an extra amount of sadness added, the performances invested with a level of intensity and fiery soul that had only been hinted at before. Listening to the incendiary guitar solo on the title track, the power of Wasner's vocals on âWe Are Wealthâ (and really throughout the album, as she has become one of the stronger indie rock vocalists around) or pounding drive of âHoly Holy,â for example, itâs clear that the band have fully invested themselves in the music this time. Not that they hadnât previously, itâs just that this time out, they seem to want it more, and theyâre playing and singing like thereâs something important at stake. As before, the music is a rich blend of influences, though there may be a little more melancholy folk in the mix this time than there is shoegaze or dream pop. The duo stick mainly to guitars and drums with the occasional keyboards for texture; the electronic influences that came into play on the My Neighbor/My Creator EP being mostly forgotten. Overall, it's very similar to past records but different somehow. Itâs rare that a band gets better after releasing a few albums; usually their initial inspiration gets used up and they are left foundering. Wye Oak have done it, and on Civilian, they insert themselves into the upper echelon of indie rock bands. ~ Tim Sendra",

        "summary": "Clapton Chronicles ignores Eric Clapton's 1983 Reprise debut, Money and Cigarettes (which sounded more like an RSO album anyway), starting with the pair of Phil Collins-produced mid-'80s albums, Behind the Sun and August. Though these had a pop sheen, they were album rock holdovers. Clapton didn't get the balance between hard rock and commercial gloss right until 1989's Journeyman, whose featured songs -- \"Before You Accuse Me,\" \"Bad Love,\" and \"Pretending\" -- form the heart of this compilation. Journeyman was overshadowed by the phenomenal success of \"Tears in Heaven\" and 1992's Unplugged. Not only did Unplugged go platinum ten times, it established a new public image -- classy, stylish, and substantial. That's the image that prevails on Clapton Chronicles. His triple-platinum blues album From the Cradle is written out of the picture, with songs from movie soundtracks taking its place. Apart from the Babyface-produced \"Change the World,\" these tunes are a little too self-conscious and subdued, as are selections from 1998's Pilgrim. However, this deliberate move to paint Clapton's '80s and '90s recordings as adult contemporary fare is accurate. Clapton's musical journey from 1985 to 1999 was taken mostly in the middle of the road, and Clapton Chronicles certainly captures that journey, missing no major hits from the late '80s and '90s. Whether it's a necessary addition to a Clapton collection is a matter of taste. It's certainly an excellent complement to Unplugged and Time Pieces, his two most popular and pop-oriented albums, but that might not be what every fan wants. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "While the release of another standards album doesn't always elicit cries of celebration, some artists are perfectly suited to such a task. Taking a romp around their own bailiwick is a breeze for pop classicists like She & Him, who offer up this platter of elegantly conceived cover songs that resembles the very source material that probably inspired their first three albums of original fare. The warm, vintage pop, jazz, and country that Zooey Deschanel and M. Ward have always seemed so smitten with comes to life on Classics. This impeccably arranged set was largely recorded live with a 20-piece orchestra fleshing out romantic chestnuts like \"Stars Fell on Alabama\" and the Johnny Mathis classic \"It's Not for Me to Say.\" With her sweet, winsome lilt, Deschanel has never really felt like a rock singer, and she seems completely in her element here interpreting these classy 20th century gems in a throwback style. Their take on Dusty Springfield's \"Stay Awhile\" sounds like vintage She & Him, while the rich orchestrations on songs like \"Oh No, Not My Baby\" and \"This Girl's in Love with You\" add a nice, sophisticated touch to their sound. Ward has plenty of chances to dispense his nimbly played, jazzy guitar tones throughout the set and takes over lead vocals on the understated \"She\" with Deschanel layering some wistful, lush backing vocals behind him. As on previous releases, the counterpoint of Deschanel's velvety croon and Ward's rugged baritone allows for some generally charming duets, and they pull off their best Ella & Louis imitation on the carefree \"Would You Like to Take a Walk?\" As a whole, the songs are well-dressed and very easy on the ears. Classics is meant to be pure entertainment and even though most of these songs have been sung before by a variety of other artists, in the hands of She & Him, it comes off less like a novelty and instead sits very comfortably in their growing catalog of fine releases. [Classics was also released on LP.] ~ Timothy Monger",

        "summary": "Maybe the Lumineers got tired of hearing other bands replicate the big-footed stomp of \"Ho Hey,\" an aesthetic that was impossible to avoid in the wake of their eponymous 2012 debut. So many bands adopted this thunderous folk that it no longer seemed to belong to the Lumineers; it appeared communal, perhaps existing to the earlier generations the Lumineers so clearly loved yet never quite replicated. Given this omnipresence, maybe it's not a surprise that the trio avoid any semblance of infectious rhythms on Cleopatra, their long-awaited second album, yet the sobriety of this 2016 affair is striking. Melancholy and sullen, Cleopatra feels like a conscious reaction to the idea that the band was merely a boisterous retro-throwback, a band that existed primarily on the surface. Apart from the lead single \"Ophelia\" and \"Cleopatra,\" this sophomore set avoids tempos that could be called sprightly, and melody comes second to mood as well. Sometimes, the Lumineers are quite effective at being evocative: there's a certain dusky shimmer to the album, an atmosphere that tends to hang as heavy as fog as the record rolls along. This sequencing, where the relatively hookier tunes are pushed toward the front, is typical in the 21st century -- albums are front-loaded to pull in casual listeners, making the bet that the serious fans will stick around for the serious stuff that arrives at the end of the record -- but this also robs Cleopatra of velocity, with whatever energy there was dissipating by the album's conclusion, when the record winds down with its quietest moments. Nevertheless, there's something admirable about the album's solemnity: the Lumineers are on a quest to be taken seriously, and even if they overplay their hand, the earnestness is ingratiating. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "In the years between their debut and Coexist, the xx's sound took on a life of its own, thanks in large part to Drake's hit duet with Rihanna, \"Take Care,\" which sampled Jamie Smith's collaboration with Gil Scott Heron, We're New Here. That single embodied and popularized the xx's aesthetic to such a degree that on first listen, Coexist can sound like demos for a potential follow-up. In turn, these songs lay the trio's R&B roots bare, with an extra emphasis on that last word: while second albums are where bands usually add more elements to their sound to keep things interesting, the xx go even darker and sparer than they were on their debut, which was pretty sparse and dark to begin with. On the lovely album opener \"Angels,\" elegantly serpentine guitars -- which recalled the Cure and Durutti Column on xx but are now entirely their own -- echo into spectral shadows, and fragments of beats and melodies hang unresolved in the air, surrounded by vast expanses of nothingness. Any track here makes \"Basic Space\" or \"Crystalised\" sound like an Arcade Fire song by comparison, but the xx walk the fine line between minimalism and incomplete-sounding confidently. All that silence throws the album's subtle sounds into sharp relief, highlighting the luminous keyboards and percussion on \"Try\" and \"Tides\"' undulating bassline more effectively than cranking up the volume on them would have. Coexist's barely-there arrangements mean that singers Oliver Sim and Romy Madley Croft do most of the heavy lifting, but they're both more than capable of carrying the album's intimacy and humanity. While their solo tracks show how much both of them have grown as singers since xx, Sim in particular has become more polished and emotive, sounding even sadder and more seductive on \"Fiction\" when he sighs \"last night the world was beneath us.\" However, Coexist's heart lies in Sim and Madley Croft's duets. The pair sounds more entwined than ever, and whether they're close together in Coexist's vast spaces, as on \"Our Song\"'s final glimmer of hope, or separated by them, as on \"Chained,\" they share an intimacy that makes listeners feel like they're eavesdropping. But while there's no question that this album is more accomplished than xx, it's also less accessible; these songs just aren't as immediate as the band's debut, and at times, these tales of love gone wrong or gone away threaten to become repetitive. Still, there are so many moments of spine-tingling beauty, such as the way \"Reunion\" blends almost imperceptibly into \"Sunset,\" or Madley Croft and Sim's shared sigh on \"Unfold,\" that they're worth a little patience from the listener. Coexist's exploration of isolation and intimacy is demanding and rewarding in its bold subtlety and eloquent simplicity. ~ Heather Phares",

Considering that Smith released three albums in 2010, it wouldn't be surprising if he had taken some time off, but he spent most of the time between that output and Color Map recording with musicians in Brooklyn, New Orleans, and his own studio. After pressing the results of the sessions on vinyl and sampling them, Smith came up with an even more organic version of the Pretty Lights sound that he describes as a \"multi-medium map of my mind and self.\" Songs such as the dreamy collages \"Yellow Bird\" and \"Press Pause\" showcase his flair for psychedelic layers, while \"Prophet\" and \"Let's Get Busy\" reflect the harder, more danceable side of his music. [A Color Map of the Sun was also released on LP.] ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "On the surface of things, Combat Rock appears to be a retreat from the sprawling stylistic explorations of London Calling and Sandinista! The pounding arena rock of \"Should I Stay or Should I Go\" makes the Clash sound like an arena rock band, and much of the album boasts a muscular, heavy sound courtesy of producer Glyn Johns. But things aren't quite that simple. Combat Rock contains heavy flirtations with rap, funk, and reggae, and it even has a cameo by poet Allen Ginsberg -- if this album is, as it has often been claimed, the Clash's sellout effort, it's a very strange way to sell out. Even with the infectious, dance-inflected new wave pop of \"Rock the Casbah\" leading the way, there aren't many overt attempts at crossover success, mainly because the group is tearing in two separate directions. Mick Jones wants the Clash to inherit the Who's righteous arena rock stance, and Joe Strummer wants to forge ahead into black music. The result is an album that is nearly as inconsistent as Sandinista!, even though its finest moments -- \"Should I Stay or Should I Go,\" \"Rock the Casbah,\" \"Straight to Hell\" -- illustrate why the Clash were able to reach a larger audience than ever before with the record. [In 2013, Sony reissued and remastered Combat Rock.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

Not everything on Coming Up for Air is slow -- \"Unclear\" is bookended by \"Human Again\" and \"Lost,\" the two songs that have some fuzz and pulse -- but it feels as if this is as calm as a placid lake. Sometimes, the record is as pretty as that, too, a nice, polite collection of adult alternative pop designed for young girls and their moms -- music designed to disappear into the background of whatever public function you choose.

But there was no track as focused as \"Sultans of Swing,\" even if \"Lady Writer\" (a lesser singles chart entry on both sides of the Atlantic) nearly duplicated its sound. As a result, CommuniquÃ© sold immediately to Dire Straits' established audience, but no more, and it did not fare as well critically as its predecessor or its follow-up. ~ William Ruhlmann",

        "summary": "The problem with assembling an Eagles collection in 2003 is that there already is a perfect Eagles collection: 1976's Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975). Although it spanned a mere ten songs and summarized only the first five years and four albums of their career, it pulled off a nifty trick by making the albums it summarized -- and by extension, the band -- seem better than they actually were. By concentrating on big hits and substituting album track \"Desperado\" for \"Outlaw Man,\" a single that didn't receive much chart action, the collection captured the band's peak, making a convincing case for the band's strengths while providing a compulsively enjoyable listen. Of course, the Eagles continued to have hits after the 1976 release of Their Greatest Hits, scoring the biggest proper album of their career that very year with Hotel California. After that, egos and infighting hampered the band, leading to just one more album in 1979's The Long Run before a disbandment in 1982, which was followed 12 years later by a reunion, charmingly dubbed Hell Freezes Over, since most pundits predicted that's when the band would reunite. This isn't much new ground to cover for a compilation, as the spotty 1982 The Eagles Greatest Hits, Vol. 2 illustrated, but even with a box set like 2000's Selected Works, there was room for a collection that contained all their big hits on one or two discs: hence the birth of Warner Strategic Marketing's 2003 double-disc Eagles collection, The Very Best Of. \r\nThere's little question that The Very Best Of does its job well, containing nearly all of the group's charting singles -- including the non-LP seasonal tune \"Please Come Home for Christmas\" and omitting the purposely ignored \"Outlaw Man\" along with a couple of reunion-era singles that didn't make much impact -- and filling out the margins with album rock staples such as \"Doolin-Dalton,\" \"Ol' 55,\" \"Victim of Love,\" \"In the City,\" and \"Those Shoes.\" It's a good collection, eliminating the need to own actual Eagles albums by containing all the key songs from each effort, including the highlights from Hell Freezes Over. If there are quibbles, the biggest is that the first disc isn't nearly as compulsively listenable as Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975), which covers the same ground, with the second being that after Hotel California the collection runs out of steam a little bit, as the Eagles sound more like a collective of solo performers instead of a band -- but that's the run of their career, too. In any case, The Very Best Of is an excellent way to get all the Eagles' songs that matter on one collection. [The Very Best Of was also released as a limited-edition three-disc set with the third disc being a bonus DVD containing the video for the new song \"Hole in the World,\" as well as a making of the video featurette and \"Backstage Pass to Farewell 1.\"] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Starting in 2009 with their album Tight Knit, it's become more and more difficult to hear the pastoral, folky beginnings of Vetiver in their music. That album was a slickly made pop confection and 2011's The Errant Charm drew heavily from '70s soft rock, resulting in something even more easy to digest and also easier to imagine coming from the speakers in the waiting rooms of slightly hip dentists and insurance agents around the nation. Andy Cabic and his main collaborator Thom Monahan continue their quest to chart the ship for the smoothest waters possible on Complete Strangers. Even more than the past two albums, this one has all the rough edges delicately sanded off and then re-covered with the slickest materials possible, whether they are backing vocals that feel like they've been lifted from an Atlanta Rhythm Section album, gentle electronic washes and clipped drum machines, or guitars that are layered so tightly that you couldn't slip one of Stevie Nicks' scarves through them. It makes for an album that's easy to swallow, but hard to taste. The duo's desire to strip the music of all energy leaves the songs limp, unable to make an impression in an age when songs are screaming for attention everywhere you turn. Maybe that was the plan, to create a tiny world of peace and calm, where the cares of the day are swept away by the quietly undulating waves of song and Cabic's drowsy vocals. The problem is that without any emotion, even a shred, in the vocals to latch onto or any hooks in the songs to grab you, it makes for a dull, lazy voyage. A couple tracks even feel like they were made to be listened to on a boat (\"Current Carry\") or a beach (\"Time Flies By\"), and that's just not where Vetiver ought to be found. Only a couple songs have any of the woozy energy or imagination that made previous albums a treat to listen to: \"Stranger Still,\" which opens the album with an epic-length electropop flash of energy that is sadly discarded as soon as the song fades out; and the chiming folk-rocker \"Loose Ends,\" which arrives halfway through to give the listener a welcome slap. Other than those two tracks, the rest of the album is sleepy enough that even legendarily mellow dude Jack Johnson would get bored halfway through and start looking for something a little zippier. A more balanced feel, a few songs with memorable hooks, some passion from Cabic, arrangements that aren't stifling -- these are the things the album lacks and desperately needs. It's always tough to see a band as consistently good as Vetiver take a stumble; one can only hope they can recover from this slumbering disaster next time out. ~ Tim Sendra",

        "parentTitle": "Slow Club",
        "summary": "The third album by Sheffield twosome Slow Club continues the British duo's expansion from agents of winsome folk-pop to evolved romantics with a set of torchy songs and break-up ballads that exude the moody spark of classic Northern Soul. It's a long way from the sweet acoustic tales of young love and bouncy, Spector-ish pop of their 2009 debut Yeah, So? It's a sound they flirted with on 2011's more confident follow-up Paradise, but it's delivered here on Complete Surrender with more subtlety and aplomb thanks to producer and Richard Hawley co-conspirator Colin Elliot. The band is comprised of singers and multi-instrumentalists Rebecca Taylor and Charles Watson who, in the past, have let their songs wander freely with either a minimalist acoustic guitar/vocal arrangement or an all-in electric, garage rock whomp. With Elliot's help, Complete Surrender becomes the fine-tuned successor that dials in on their strengths, which in this care are Taylor's strong voice and the duo's improved songcraft. Standouts of Slow Club's new sound, like the bluesy ballads \"The Queen's Nose\" and \"Not Mine to Love,\" balance a sleek, cool maturity with subtle doses of their endearing, raw charm. The Northern Soul influence is most apparent on the witchy send-up \"Suffering You, Suffering Me,\" whose yearning intro quickly picks up into a classic, horn-laden, '60s-inspired dance/soul number. Watson gets his licks in too, singing lead on the slow-building \"Everything Is New,\" which boasts a wild crescendo of stacked vocals, strings, and filthy guitar tones. The flame dims a bit near the album's end, but plays out on a strong note with the more contemporary-sounding \"Wanderer Wandering,\" a catchy ballad that pairs rich synths with dreamy trumpet to great effect. Complete Surrender shows that Taylor and Watson are willing to stretch out and continue their evolution as they deliver a strong third outing. [Complete Surrender was also released on LP.] ~ Timothy Monger",

        "summary": "One year after George Harrison's death, his friends, led by Eric Clapton, organized a tribute concert to him at the Royal Albert Hall on November 29, 2002. The concert was filmed and recorded, resulting in a 100-minute theatrical feature, as well as a two-CD set and this two-DVD package. Contained here is the feature, which edits and re-sequences the concert while inserting interview and rehearsal footage, as well as the complete concert, with a running time of two-and-a-half hours. Several songs -- \"That's the Way It Goes,\" \"I Need You,\" and \"Wah Wah\" -- were left out of the feature entirely, and \"Old Brown Shoe\" and \"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\" were used only to underscore the end titles, with no accompanying footage. All this material is restored in the complete concert version. The concert actually opened with a lengthy Indian music segment, featuring Anoushka Shankar under the guidance of her father, Ravi Shankar. Anoushka Shankar's sitar solo, \"Your Eyes,\" is not included in the feature, and the entire Indian sequence, which turns up about an hour into the feature, has been cut down to less than 15 minutes, with interviews and voiceovers often running with the music. The Western music also suffers such interruptions on occasion, but the filmmakers clearly were concerned that there not be too much Indian music in the feature. In a sense, this means that the feature works better for casual George Harrison fans, while the complete concert is what the more ardent fans will prefer. For both, the music is well performed, as Clapton & co. recreate the often elaborate arrangements of Harrison's music, using multiple guitarists, keyboardists, and percussionists, backed by an orchestra. The stage band is a who's who of Harrison's peers, including his Beatle bandmates Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, Jeff Lynne, Billy Preston, and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, among others. Most Americans will not recognize Joe Brown, a well-preserved British pop star of the pre-Beatles era who does an excellent version of \"Here Comes the Sun,\" and closes the proceedings with the 1920s pop tune \"I'll See You in My Dreams.\" Harrison's film association with the Monty Python comedy troupe is referenced by a hilarious appearance by most of the members of the group, with Tom Hanks almost unnoticed as a mountie in \"The Lumberjack Song.\" Thus, the concert gives a well-rounded portrait of Harrison's music and interests. ~ William Ruhlmann",

        "summary": "After the smashing success of Oracular Spectacular, it was clear that MGMT were going to be at a bit of a crossroads when it came time to follow it up. Would they try to simply re-create their single-rich debut and pray that they avoided the sophomore slump, or would they continue to evolve? Fortunately for the listening public at large, they opted for the latter, delivering a follow-up album that matches, if not triumphs over, their earlier work. Always moving forward, the band has stepped out from the shadow of sonic auteur Dave Fridmann, producing the album themselves with the help of Spacemen 3âs Sonic Boom. The end product is a sound that owes more to Phil Spector than the Flaming Lips, managing to be atmospheric without necessarily being spacious. MGMT have taken a more dynamic approach to songwriting on this album, tossing aside the dancing thump of âElectric Feelâ and âKidsâ in favor of songs that build in a more deliberate and satisfying way. âFlash Deliriumâ folds upon itself again and again, ramping up to a Wall of Sound chorus before letting loose with a big, glam/garage finish, as if to vent off any excess musical pressure before heading into the more subdued âI Found a Whistle.â This kind of careful songwriting tracks all throughout the album, giving Congratulations a more cohesive feeling. While this kind of musical vision means there isnât really a clear-cut single, it does make for an all around better album. MGMT has matured as a band, and to show that off, theyâve returned by making the album that they wanted to make rather than the collection of loosely related singles that was expected from them. From the opening moments of the sublime âItâs Workingâ all the way to the titular closer, Congratulations is an incredible follow-up from a band that is still maturing into some unknown entity. ~ Gregory Heaney",

        "summary": "Throughout 1969 and into 1970, CCR toured incessantly and recorded nearly as much. Appropriately, Cosmo's Factory's first single was the working band's anthem \"Travelin' Band,\" a funny, piledriving rocker with a blaring horn section -- the first indication their sonic palette was broadening. Two more singles appeared prior to the album's release, backed by John Fogerty originals that rivaled the A-side or paled just slightly. When it came time to assemble a full album, Fogerty had only one original left, the claustrophobic, paranoid rocker \"Ramble Tamble.\" Unlike some extended instrumentals, this was dramatic and had a direction -- a distinction made clear by the meandering jam that brings CCR's version of \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" to 11 minutes. Even if it wanders, their take on the Marvin Gaye classic isn't unpleasant, and their faithful, exuberant takes on the Sun classics \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"My Baby Left Me\" are joyous tributes. Still, the heart of the album lays in those six fantastic songs released on singles. \"Up Around the Bend\" is a searing rocker, one of their best, balanced by the menacing murkiness of \"Run Through the Jungle.\" \"Who'll Stop the Rain\"'s poignant melody and melancholy undertow has a counterpart in Fogerty's dope song, \"Lookin' out My Back Door,\" a charming, bright shuffle, filled with dancing animals and domestic bliss - he had never been as sweet and silly as he is here. On \"Long as I Can See the Light,\" the record's final song, he again finds solace in home, anchored by a soulful, laid-back groove. It hits a comforting, elegiac note, the perfect way to draw Cosmo's Factory -- an album made during stress and chaos, filled with raging rockers, covers, and intense jams -- to a close. [Cosmo's Factory was re-released on LP in 2015.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Brash, melodic, and imbued with a more-than-healthy sense of British rock tradition, the Fratellis and their debut album, Costello Music, come across almost like a caricature of bands like the Libertines, Dirty Pretty Things, and Arctic Monkeys -- but at least it's a flattering one. The Fratellis take themselves a lot less seriously than some of the other laddish bands popular in the U.K. in the late 2000s, and emphasize hooks and fun rather than samey-sounding rock. Songs like \"Baby Fratelli\" and \"The Gutterati\" have a singalong simplicity, and it feels like the band puts as many \"la la la\"s and \"ba da ba\"s into each song as they can -- and then try to cram in a few more. Costello Music's best tracks go even farther with the band's fun-only agenda; it's easy to hear why \"Flathead\" -- which switches between grinding, aggressive verses and a downright giddy chorus with more of those \"ba da bop a dah\" hooks -- was picked to soundtrack a fittingly day-glo, kinetic iPod TV commercial. The outstanding single \"Chelsea Dagger\" is just as vibrant, a swaggering glam rock nugget with pints-aloft choruses. \"Henrietta\"'s loopy catchiness owes a debt to vaudeville or musical comedy, and not just because Jon Fratelli sings \"wa wa wa waaaahhh\" along with the guitar solo; \"For the Girl,\" meanwhile, has a melody so strong, it could've been a hit anytime between the '60s and the '90s. Elsewhere on Costello Music, the Fratellis show off their knowledge of other corners of rock history: \"Vince the Lovable Stoner\" is appealing faux country-rock; \"Doginabag\" adds some blues and grit to their sound; and \"Creepin' Up the Back Stairs\" nods to '50s rock and skiffle. Even when the band gets a little more complex, as on the darkly twangy \"Got Ma Nuts from a Hippy,\" they keep the focus on rapid-fire rhythms and air guitar-ready solos. Indeed, Costello Music is so high-energy, it's almost too much to take in one sitting. Then again, this music wasn't made for sitting, it was made for dancing yourself silly. They might not have the cultural or historical impact of some of their peers, but the Fratellis are a lot of fun in the moment -- whenever that moment is. [A U.K. version was also released.] ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "On the The Covers Record, Chan Marshall continues her evolution into a remarkably expressive interpreter of songs; her earlier covers of Pavement's \"We Dance\" and Smog's \"Bathysphere\" are among her most distinctive performances. This collection includes songs originally by Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, the Velvet Underground, Moby Grape, Michael Hurley, and Anonymous. Marshall's sparest album yet, The Covers Record uses guitar and piano as the only foils for her malleable, emotional voice. These tools are more than enough to turn the Stones' anthem \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" into a bluesy, slinky version emphasizing the song's tension and frustration as much as its jaded sexiness, and \"Kingston Town\" from a reggae standard into a hymnal reflection. Marshall's gentle version of Hurley's \"Sweedeedee\" and plaintive reading of the Velvets' \"I Found a Reason\" recall the quietest, most spiritual moments from Moon Pix. This culminates on the cover of her own \"In This Hole\" from What Would the Community Think; one of the most drastic revisions, its soft pianos and serene vocals replace the original's turbulent anguish, reflecting her changing musical path. Marshall explores many emotional directions, from her yearning version of Moby Grape's \"Naked If I Want To\" to her brooding sensuality on \"Wild Is the Wind,\" to her down-home optimism on Bob Dylan's \"Paths of Victory.\" \"Salty Dog\"'s lilting melody and humorous lyrics bring out Marshall's Georgia twang, while her version of Smog's \"Red Apples\" shows off her voice's sensual lows and keening highs. The joyous cover of \"Sea of Love\" (originally by Phil Phillips) brings this accomplished, heartfelt Covers Record to a very happy end. ~ Heather Phares",

The 19-track, 79-minute Cream of Clapton disc surveys his career, presenting an excellent selection from the period, including the Cream hits \"Sunshine of Your Love,\" \"White Room,\" and \"Crossroads\"; \"Presence of the Lord,\" Clapton's finest moment with Blind Faith; \"Bell Bottom Blues\" and \"Layla\" from Derek and the Dominos; and 11 songs from Clapton's solo work, among them the hits \"I Shot the Sheriff,\" \"Promises,\" and \"I Can't Stand It.\" The selection is thus broader and better than that found on 1982's Time Pieces collection, and with excellent sound and liner notes by Clapton biographer Ray Coleman, The Cream of Clapton stands as the single-disc best-of to own for Clapton's greatest recordings.

        "summary": "As rock music moved forward in new and unexpected directions in the latter part of the '60s, no band merged the virtues of past and present as well as Creedence Clearwater Revival. The group clearly drew from the classic sounds of blues, R&B, rockabilly, and swamp rock, but they played with an energy and imagination that was entirely up to date, and they were one of the few bands who could dive into an extended jam on occasion while still understanding the beauty of the three-minute single. And the group's leader, John Fogerty, was one of the finest American songwriters to emerge in the second half of the '60s, building on classic American archetypes while expressing the rage and tumult of his times. Between 1968 and 1972, the prolific group released seven studio albums, and The 40th Anniversary Editions Box Set features all of them, presented complete and with bonus tracks, documenting the full arc of Creedence Clearwater Revival's remarkable career. Albums included are Creedence Clearwater Revival (1968), Bayou Country (1969), Green River (1969), Willy and the Poor Boys (1969), Cosmo's Factory (1970), Pendulum (1970), and Mardi Gras (1972). ~ Mark Deming",

        "summary": "John Coltrane's Crescent from the spring of 1964 is an epic album, showing his meditative side that would serve as a perfect prelude to his immortal work A Love Supreme. His finest quartet with McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison, and Elvin Jones supports the somewhat softer side of Coltrane, and while not completely in ballad style, the focus and accessible tone of this recording work wonders for anyone willing to sit back and let this music enrich and wash over you. While not quite at the \"sheets of sound\" unfettered music he would make before his passing in 1967, there are hints of this group stretching out in restrained dynamics, playing as lovely a progressive jazz as heard anywhere in any time period. The highlights come at the top with the reverent, ruminating, and free ballad \"Crescent,\" with a patient Coltrane acquiescing to swinging, while the utterly beautiful \"Wise One\" is accented by the delicate and chime-like musings of Tyner with a deeply hued tenor from Coltrane unrushed even in a slight Latin rhythm. These are the ultimate spiritual songs, and ultimately two of the greatest in Coltrane's storied career. But \"Bessie's Blues\" and \"Lonnie's Lament\" are just as revered in the sense that they are covered by jazz musicians worldwide, the former a hard bop wonder with a classic short repeat chorus, the latter one of the most somber, sad jazz ballad reflections in a world full of injustice and unfairness -- the ultimate eulogy. Garrison and especially Jones are put through their emotional paces, but on the finale \"The Drum Thing,\" the African-like tom-tom sounds extracted by Jones with Coltrane's sighing tenor, followed by some truly amazing case study-frantic snare drumming, makes it one to be revisited. In the liner notes, a quote from Leroi Jones/Amiri Baraka states John Coltrane was \"daringly human,\" and no better example of this quality transferred to musical endeavor is available than on this definitive, must have album that encompasses all that he was and eventually would become. ~ Michael G.

        "summary": "Supertramp came into their own on their third album, 1974's Crime of the Century, as their lineup gelled but, more importantly, so did their sound. The group still betrayed a heavy Pink Floyd influence, particularly in its expansive art rock arrangements graced by saxophones, but Supertramp isn't nearly as spooky as Floyd -- they're snarky collegiate elitists, an art rock variation on Steely Dan or perhaps a less difficult 10cc, filled with cutting jokes and allusions, best heard on \"Bloody Well Right.\" This streak would later flourish on Breakfast in America, but it's present enough to give them their own character. Also present is a slight sentimental streak and a heavy fondness for pop, heard on \"Dreamer,\" a soaring piece of art pop that became their first big hit. That and \"Bloody Well Right\" are the concise pop moments on the record; the rest of Crime of the Century is atmospheric like Dark Side of the Moon, but with a lighter feel and a Beatles bent. At times the album floats off into its own world, with an effect more tedious than hypnotic, but it's still a huge leap forward for the group and their most consistent album outside of that 1979 masterwork, Breakfast in America. [The album was reissued in 2014 with the addition of a second disc that contained a full-length live show recorded in 1975, during which the band played the whole album and a few other choice cuts.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

Spanning four discs and consisting almost entirely of live material (there are a handful of studio outtakes), this is music that will only enthrall completists and archivists. For those listeners, there is a wealth of fascinating, compelling performances here, as well as a fair share of mediocre, uninspired tracks. The key word for the entire album is detail -- it is an album for studying the intricacies of Eric Clapton's playing and how it evolved. For example, it's easy to hear the differences and progressions between the four versions of Robert Johnson's \"Rambling on My Mind.\" And it is Clapton that evolves, not his supporting band -- although they are proficient, they are hardly exciting. However, their static, professional support provides a nice bed to chart Slowhand's growth over the course of the decade, simply because he is always the focal point. Crossroads 2 may only be for a collector, but for those collectors, it is a treasure, even if some of the tracks are fool's gold. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

The band constantly moves through new territories, defying a simple definition or a simple parallel to another band. However, they do so while maintaining an excellent, intriguing sound. Frontman Jae Laffer gives a husky delivery that swoons just a bit here and there over the top of a layer of guitar and drums, an occasional bit of keyboard inflection, and depending on the song, a bit of classic Motown-style strings (occasionally replaced by a synth version nostalgic for the Motown sound). The album opens with perhaps the most Motown-heavy piece, handclaps and strings triumphantly announcing the group's entrance. The strings are a little less Motown and a little more Coldplay in \"Ruins,\" and bent a little toward Asian pop in \"Creaks.\" Still, the band itself provides a steady, strong backing, and Laffer provides almost a narrative-style delivery, throaty in its timbre, breathy even. The band tells their stories, touching on the grey areas of pop, alluding to U2 in the rhythm guitar for a moment in \"Live Without.\" They touch on darker beach songs in \"Confess,\" they evoke contemporary Bob Dylan recordings in \"Sundowner,\" with an almost weary, dim delivery but a grandiose chorus movement. The album defies a clear definition other than \"adult contemporary,\" but it's attractive, it's catchy, and it's exploratory all at once. Definitely worth a spin or two. ~ Adam Greenberg",

        "summary": "UB40's 2005 release Who You Fighting For? was the British reggae group's finest album in many years, an admission of sorts that the band had been wallowing in sameness for some time and needed an injection of new ideas if it was to stay afloat. But this live CD predates it by three years, and although from the sound of it the Montreux audience was in the band's thrall from the first seconds of the show -- a cover of the Temptations' \"The Way You Do the Things You Do\" -- the 2002 set mostly serves to remind just how complacent UB40 had become. Technically, the band is, as ever, flawlessly tight, and singer Ali Campbell's trademark nasality is endearing as he helms the group through a typical set of older hits and well-chosen covers. But the performance is so polished that it loses the rawness endemic to true roots reggae. You will undoubtedly find yourself singing along to the chart smashes \"Red, Red Wine,\" \"Here I Am (Come and Take Me)\" and \"(I Can't Help) Falling in Love with You,\" and perhaps that is the point of a concert by a band with such a long, proven track record. But this is as safe a reggae album as you'll ever hear, not nearly as satisfying in the end as what the venerable Brits would cook up the next time out. ~ Jeff Tamarkin",

        "summary": "Crystal Castles' self-titled debut helped take 8-bit synth tones into the mainstream. That jagged, strangely naÃ¯ve sound of old-school video games is so distinctive that it could easily define the duoâs music instead of vice versa, but Ethan Kath and Alice Glass avoid that trap on their second, also self-titled album. Glass and Kath are still committed to the 8-bit assaults of their early singles and debut -- check the bookending blasts âFainting Spellsâ and âI Am Made of Chalkâ for proof -- but Crystal Castles covers more territory than that. The duo finds different ways to mix icy synth pop with white-hot noise, as well as present them in an ever so slightly more polished form. Two of the albumâs singles show just how Crystal Castles' sound has evolved: âDoe Deerâ is even harsher, more thoroughly spindled and mutilated than âAlice Practice,â yet the melody shines through underneath all the pixelated distortion; âCelestica,â meanwhile, puts the focus on Glass' decidedly clear, melancholy vocals and the four-on-the-floor beat. Though 8-bit synths arenât as prominent here as they were on the bandâs earlier work, Crystal Castles still love repurposing seemingly obsolete and unfashionable sounds: âBaptismâ's brassy blasts hark back to at least the early â90s. Despite tangents like âBirds,â Crystal Castles overall has a much darker and cleaner sound than its predecessor, expanding on the softer, more esoteric territory the band ventured into on the debutâs second half. âVietnamâ and âPap Smearâ pair controversial titles with unabashedly pretty and brooding songs. If anything, this album shows that Crystal Castles are a pop band at heart, albeit an extremely warped one, and their sonic tricks work best when harnessed to honest-to-goodness songs. âEmpathyâ adds R&B-tinged beats to Glassâ far-off singing, while âSuffocationâ and âNot in Loveâ still sparkle like pristine synth pop should, even if they sound like theyâve been put through a shredder. The second Crystal Castles may not be as immediate as their debut, but it shows that the band has more to offer than just a distinctive -- and confining -- sound.

        "summary": "After a long break from making Tame Impala music, during which time Kevin Parker produced other people's albums and played in side projects, 2015's Currents shows that much has changed with the project. Like before, Parker recorded the album on his own, only this time without Dave Fridmann's guiding hand and by mostly forsaking electric guitars in favor of a wealth of synthesizers, and this time out there's a much more relaxed, intimate approach. In addition to the soft rock of the '70s feel that permeates the sound, Parker adds elements of R&B and hip-hop to the mix, gets lyrically introspective in spots, and generally sounds like he's either on the verge of a long nap or just waking up from one. These aren't bad things when done right, and Parker's prowess as a producer and musician makes most of Currents palatable, if not extremely exciting. However, by focusing on all these new elements, and by sleepwalking through at least half of the songs, this new way of doing things does a lot to frustrate the expectations of anyone looking to this album as another mind-blowing expression of guitar-heavy psych-pop. It's hard to deny artists the chance for change or growth, and Parker seems dedicated to both here. Where you can fault them is if they don't change or grow in an interesting or unique way. Great chunks of Currents sound like plenty of other bands and artists in 2015, especially since practically everyone with access to recording equipment did their own takes on midtempo, chilled-out R&B. Does Parker do it as well as others like Unknown Mortal Orchestra or Caribou? Sure, he does. Is it enough to make this album worth checking out? Yes, but it's not enough to make it an improvement over his previous work. At Tame Impala's best, they blend huge guitar sounds, melodic basslines, and vintage synths into sweeping psychedelic rock with energy and drive that feel hugely cinematic while still feeling real. There are only a couple times here when Parker comes close to that sweet spot. For example, the both \"Let It Happen\" and \"Reality in Motion\" have a good blend of guitars and synths and a sense of purpose that's often missing elsewhere. There are far more times where he strays too far from his strengths and gets bogged down in meandering, overly smoothed-out sounds and meandering songs that deliver no real payoff or sound half-baked at best, like the embarrassingly weak \"Cause I'm a Man.\" It's too bad that Parker stashed his guitars away instead of keeping them around to add to the mix. It's definitely not a case of addition by subtraction; it's quite the opposite. While Currents would have made a decent Kevin Parker solo album, people coming to the album and expecting to hear the Tame Impala they are used to will most likely end up quite disappointed.

A trip through Albarn's oddities is still more rewarding than many other artists' magnum opuses: \"68 State\"'s moody synth noodling could soundtrack an anime dystopia; \"Hongkongaton\" fuses dub and music hall; and \"People\" could be the mutant offspring of Brit-pop and synth pop. Albarn also gathered an on-point cast of remixers, including Metronomy, Hot Chip, and the DFA, who turn in a belligerent, percussive version of \"Dare,\" which inspired standout reworkings by Junior Sanchez and Soulwax. Overall, this is a fun, eclectic set. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "Following Bigfoot's success, Cayucas' Zach and Ben Yudin drafted producer Ryan Hadlock to work on Dancing at the Blue Lagoon. Hadlock, whose other clients include the Lumineers and Brandi Carlile, lends the band's second album an expensive sheen: \"Ditches\"' flutes and pianos are downright lush, while the acoustic guitar on the title track is nothing less than flawless. Touches like these might objectively sound better than Bigfoot, but they don't do the band any favors. Blue Lagoon's glossier surroundings make the Yudins' songs seem more derivative than before, pointing out their similarities to the Shins and Vampire Weekend in ways that feel glaring instead of familiar. Bigfoot's intimacy and breeziness made these homages easier to take, but here Cayucas' smooth tenor vocals, jangly guitars, and verbose lyrics lack the charm of either of the aforementioned acts at their best, or that they themselves had on their debut. Even Dancing at the Blue Lagoon's best songs sound overly labored. \"Big Winter Jacket\"'s oversized chamber pop and the lilting \"Moony Eyed Walrus\" deliver a nice-enough, Platonic ideal of 2010s indie rock devoid of individuality; it's only on \"A Shadow in the Dark\" that the Yudins come close to recapturing the joyous spirit that animated Bigfoot. Unfortunately, Cayucas end up faring worse when they try to bring some quirk into the proceedings, whether on \"Hella\"'s grating chorus or the odd, unpleasant backing vocals on the otherwise ultra-smooth \"Backstroke.\" While Dancing at the Blue Lagoon brings Cayucas' shortcomings to the fore, more often than not it's more blandly pleasant than irritating, serving up a watered-down tropical drink of an album that just doesn't connect the way Bigfoot did. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "It is true that Weird Al Yankovic went into this third album with a huge hit behind him, the first of several satires of Michael Jackson he would be involved in, entitled \"Eat It.\" And it is also true that only someone who is missing important brain cells would suggest this artist's original songs are any good, although there are a few small signs of improvement here on Dare to Be Stupid. Yet the notion that the latter material was given free reign over the course of this album, neglecting the parody songs that had made Yankovic rich and famous, is pure poppycock. The album begins with what is perhaps his best parody ever, the brilliant and cutting \"Like a Surgeon.\" Turning the tacky Madonna hit inside out and upside down, Yankovic comes up with a hilarious satire of the medical profession. By now it was required that his videos be even funnier than the recordings they promoted, and a case could be made that the video of \"Like a Surgeon\" is really where the action is, however enjoyable the song itself may be. Although the implications were probably missed by the none too bright Madonna, and may not have even been intentional on the part of Yankovic, it was a rich idea to use his parody to ridicule a serious subject rather than just take another poke at junk food or game shows. The record's title track follows, and it is the best of Yankovic's original songs that had been recorded so far, although that isn't saying much. Any song that begins with a request to put down your chain saw can't be all bad. It was material that was supposedly aimed at 11 year olds, but although there was limited use of the expression \"dare to be stupid\" to encourage stupidity, what else, among this age group, few children have ever been heard were humming this song or any of the other originals that are featured on this record. One of the best tracks is the amazing medley \"Hooked on Polkas\" that concludes the album. Yankovic goes for broke here, his slick band barely keeping up with him as he drags all manner of hit parade schlock through the harmonic wringer washer known as the accordion. It's a hell of a trip, including references to Z.Z. Top as well as disco and punk rock, and accomplishes more musically in less than four minutes than an entire evening with the likes of Brave Combo. Some of the other parodies are weaker, although \"Girls Just Want to Have Lunch\" bears the distinction of actually being related in philosophy to the original it is based on, a first for Yankovic. Voice-over artist Bill Scott plays himself in a cover of \"George of the Jungle,\" hardly a track that will inspire repeated plays. Neither will \"Yoda,\" although there was obviously no way in such a commercial enterprise to avoid paying tribute to a character that was so popular at the time. Plus, Neil Diamond had already claimed rights to an E.T. tribute. The song Yankovic uses to base his satire on is the Kinks' \"Lola,\" but when the original song is both funnier and weirder than the parody, one may wonder what the point is. The same can be said for \"I Want a New Duck,\" although it certainly is stupid, which may be the whole point. Rick Derringer put the whole production together expertly but should have played more hot lead guitar. And why couldn't this real ex-McCoy convince his client to do a parody of \"Hang on Sloopy\"? ~ Eugene Chadbourne",

        "summary": "Columbus, Ohio's Saintseneca began as a unit that distilled and expanded upon the inspiration of the folk sounds from the Appalachian range: the place songwriter, frontman, and lone original member Zac Little hails from. However, through extensive D.I.Y. touring, two previous EPs, and a full-length (2013's acclaimed Last), they've gelled into a band whose sound equals all the places they've been, rather than merely the culmination of where Little is from. Dark Arc, Saintseneca's debut for Anti, was produced by Mike Mogis. Despite its primary use of layered harmonies and acoustic instruments -- guitars, mandolins, banjos, dulcimer, baglama, drums, saw, and other hand percussion -- they also employ organs, synthesizers, pedal steel, electric guitars, samples, etc. whenever necessary. They are no longer the folk band whose charm lies in homemade sensibilities and execution, but a rock group whose approach embraces neo-psychedelia, folk, and indie pop. There are post-punk influences here, too: check the unabashed use of the Cure on \"Happy Alone.\" Little's songs are catchy musically. Some of the finer moments here include \"Daendors,\" with its bright balalaikas, dulcimer, acoustic guitar, low-end drums, handclaps, and soaring harmonies (courtesy of bandmates Maryn Jones, Steve Ciolek, and Glenn Davis). It is, despite a melancholy lyric, as bright and intoxicating as sunshine after a long winter. \"Takmit,\" with its barn-dancing foot stomps, handclaps, 12-string guitar, and bulbul, fuels an intimate love song. The tender, strange, and compelling title cut features group instrumentation tastefully colored by warm reverb and elegantly layered vocal harmonies in a lilting, yet off-kilter cadence that moves to and fro until it all erupts in a psychedelic country sprint. This is the band's first fully realized outing and points toward new directions. ~ Thom Jurek",

        "summary": "Richly detailed, alternately rugged and studio slick, the airy and expressive debut album from Montreal's Half Moon Run is caught somewhere between the pastoral, harmony-laden northwoods folk of Fleet Foxes, the hazy classic rock meanderings of Band of Horses, and the soulful midnight din of Alt-J and Jeff Buckley. Formed via a craigslist ad, the band's internal anonymity is hardly relative with regard to its cohesiveness, as each track on the brainy yet intuitive Dark Eyes sounds like the sum of its parts, but there is enough space between those parts to suggest a sort of unspoken agreement to avoid any sort of showboating. This predilection for musical mindfulness is best exemplified by album opener \"Full Circle,\" a carefully tiered, slow-burn brooder that churns along like a river swollen with menace, and then manages to explode without any sort of real violence. The effect is surprisingly and elegantly dramatic, and when Half Moon Run mine this particular cadence, as they do on standout cuts like \"No More Losing the War,\" \"Fire Escape,\" and \"Give Up,\" the latter of which sounds like it morphed out of the early moments of Radiohead's \"Paranoid Android,\" they cast a spell that can prove difficult to break free of. That elegance is retained on more mellifluous offerings like the breezy \"Call Me in the Afternoon\" and the multi-layered, electro-pop-kissed closer, \"21 Gun Salute,\" both of which lean harder toward the Alt-J side of the equation, but they lack the command of atmosphere and sense of purpose that drive the darker numbers.

        "summary": "Coming off Villagers' highly touted, Mercury Prize-nominated debut, 2010's Becoming a Jackal, singer/songwriter Conor J. O'Brien updated his group's atmospheric baroque pop sound with the addition of various synthesizers and drum machines, as well as creative collaboration with a working group of bandmates. Subsequently, Villagers' sophomore album, 2013's {Awayland}, was an even more robust, sonically layered production. Rather than sticking with a more-is-more approach, O'Brien has taken the exact opposite tack for his third album, 2015's Darling Arithmetic, forgoing a group sound and instead working once again as a true solo act. To this end, Darling Arithmetic is possibly even more insular than Becoming a Jackal, with O'Brien largely favoring acoustic guitar, piano, and softly sung lyrics ripe with the scent of a relationship in trouble. In \"Everything I Am Is Yours,\" he sings \"I am just a man/Tipping on a wire/Tightrope walking fool/Balanced on desire/I cannot control/These ever-changing ways/So how can I be sure/The feeling will remain/It'll always change.\" This skeptical desire for love is echoed later in \"Hot Scary Summer,\" as he addresses problems with a possible lover with \"So you thank me for my hard work/But you've had it up to there/'Cause this shouldn't be hard work/But I'll fight to care if you'd care to fight.\" Musically, much -- if not all -- of Darling Arithmetic is pitched at a slow, dream-inducing pace and, while lushly recorded, feels smaller in scope than even Villagers' debut. Admittedly, these are also slower-burning compositions that lack the hooks and pop immediacy of much of Villagers' previous work. Ultimately, however, the pulling back feels intentional and fitting for an album of songs that always seem born out of O'Brien's most personal experiences. As he sings on \"The Soul Serene,\" \"So I go walking on the shore/And I wonder what I'm walking for...and I find chameleon dreams in my mind.\" ~ Matt Collar",

        "summary": "The Killers' great gift is that they -- and in particular their frontman, Brandon Flowers -- have utterly no recognition of the ridiculous. More than that, they're drawn to the ridiculous, piecing together sounds that don't belong together, reaching far beyond their grasp, aiming for profundity and slipping into silliness. All this weighed the band down mightily on Sam's Town, their convoluted Americana theme park of a sophomore album, all false faÃ§ades and paper-thin pretension, but on its 2008 sequel, Day & Age, the Killers shrink the canvas and brighten their palette, opting for a big sound over big themes. Since the Killers are at their core poseurs and not prophets, style over substance is the right move and Day & Age has style for miles and miles, exceeding even their debut, Hot Fuss, in its stainless steel gleam. If anything, Hot Fuss was a little too monochromatic in its obsession with '80s synth rock, a criticism that can hardly be leveled at Day & Age, a record that stitches together sounds with an almost blissfully idiotic abandon. Anchored in dance-rock though they may be, the Killers no longer sound like mere disciples of New Order and Duran Duran: emboldened by the left turns of Sam's Town, no matter how misguided they may have been, the Killers will try anything, goosing \"Losing Touch\" with growling saxophones, creating a Strokes disco for \"Joy Ride,\" flirting with worldbeat Ã  la Vampire Weekend on \"This Is Your Life,\" dancing the bossa nova on \"I Can't Stay,\" and riding a tight soulful rock & roll groove on \"The World We Live In,\" bringing it close to a mad fusion of Steve Miller's \"Abracadabra\" and Hall & Oates' \"Private Eyes.\" Like before, it's impossible to tell if such improbable juxtapositions are intentional or accidental, but given the overall tightness of Day & Age, it feels as if the Killers do indeed mean to create these odd, often pleasing, pop pastiches. And the emphasis damn well should be on the sound and melody, for Flowers remains a downright goofy lyricist, whether he's misinterpreting Hunter S. Thompson on \"Human\" or recounting an alien abduction on \"Spaceman.\" Ridiculousness is much harder to stomach in words than it is in music, but the nice thing about Day & Age is that not only is Flowers' voice relatively buried, the Killers are unwittingly comfortable with their ludicrous, outsized pop, which turns the album into terrifically trashy pop. Not the serious rock they yearn to be by any means, but these fashionable threads fit them better anyway. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "After the near-disaster of forced democracy on Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant and the stultifying holding pattern of the Storytelling soundtrack, where Todd Solondz brought out their worst tendencies, it seemed that Belle & Sebastian were disappearing into their own preciousness, but then something unexpected happened: they returned to form with 2003's Dear Catastrophe Waitress. This was unexpected not just because their last efforts suggested that B&S no longer could produce a consistently engaging work, but because their savior came in the guise of Trevor Horn, the man who successfully helped Yes turn new wave, the man best known for his synth-heavy productions of ABC and Frankie Goes to Hollywood, the man who was last heard producing everybody's favorite Russian teen lesbian duo, Tatu. That diverse resumÃ© suggests that Horn knows how to play to a band's strengths, and he certainly helps Belle & Sebastian regain their focus and vision, turning Dear Catastrophe Waitress into one of the group's best albums. One of the reasons that album works so well is that the notion that the band has no leader has been discarded, with Stuart Murdoch thankfully serving as the lead singer and songwriter throughout the record. Murdoch's songs are firmly within the patented Belle & Sebastian style, and while it may be true that he's not stretching himself much as a writer, that doesn't matter because he sounds assured and confident, turning out a set of songs that are finely crafted and tuneful. It's among his catchiest work, if not quite his cleverest, since the words occasionally offer an overdose of whimsy that leads to queasiness. And that's where Horn comes in -- by keeping the focus on the tunes and subtly varying the production, he's made Dear Catastrophe Waitress the richest musical offering yet from Belle & Sebastian. If it doesn't quite have the timeless feel of If You're Feeling Sinister, so be it, since this is their first record since that defining album to offer a similarly rich listen, and that's quite a comeback.

        "summary": "How better to accurately convey the pain of breaking off a long-term relationship than to write and record songs about it with your ex-significant other? Apparently, Blake Hazard and John Dragonetti couldn't think of a more appropriate way, and what came out of those sessions (which eventually led to their reconciliation and marriage) was Declare a New State!, their first album as the band the Submarines. Needless to say, it's sad, pretty music that finds them reflecting about themselves and where they went wrong, never blaming anyone specifically but never accepting full responsibility, either. Each of them (they sing tracks both together and separately) puts pretty much everything out in the open for everyone to hear (\"On Super Tuesday I wanted to die...I'll never vote again,\" Dragonetti whimpers in \"Vote,\" referencing their breakup, which happened on the eve of the 2004 California presidential primary), leaving little to hide behind. This actually becomes kind of tiresome; it's as if the Submarines don't quite trust their audience to get their not-so-subtle references. In \"Brighter Discontent,\" Hazard sings lines like \"I rearranged the place a hundred times today/But the ordering of objects couldn't hide what's missing\" and \"All these things should make me happy...to be home again,\" rendering her point quite clear, but as if there were a possibility you might not understand her implications, she throws in a bridge with the phrase \"Love is not these belongings that surround me/Though there's meaning in the memories they hold\" to really drive things home, a gesture that while perhaps innocent enough, is not necessarily welcome. There are some wonderfully poignant lyrics in Declare a New State! as well (\"You got a way with words/Just sentiment without revealing how you feel,\" Hazard states in the gorgeous \"The Good Night\") that work well with the gentle guitar arrangements and melodies (which don't so much jump from the record as blend smoothly in with the layers of instrumentation) the band chooses to employ. It's all very nice, but there's not much that sticks when all is said and done, which is the album's biggest problem: its lack of distinctive qualities. It's not boring -- there are still a lot of drums and the occasional indie electronica effect on the record, but it's not going to leave any long-lasting impression, either. The music on Declare a New State! was certainly a useful tool for Dragonetti and Hazard, but it's a little too self-involved to do as much for anyone else. ~ Marisa Brown",

        "summary": "By the time Giorgio Moroder released DÃ©jÃ -Vu, the world was as ready as it could be for his return. His work on Daft Punk's Random Access Memories was the most vivid reminder of his influence on decades of dance music, but artists such as Goldfrapp and Chromatics ensured that his brand of atmospheric disco and synth pop was nearly as in vogue in the 2000s and 2010s as it was in the '70s and '80s. Despite its name, DÃ©jÃ -Vu isn't entirely a blast from the past; instead, Moroder splits the difference between making contemporary-sounding dance music and reviving disco. Sometimes he combines those impulses, nodding to his roots while shaping them into 2010s dance-pop: \"Wildstar,\" which features Foxes (who has also worked with Zedd), is one of his best fusions of old and new. He sounds most nostalgic on the album's handful of instrumentals, such as \"74 is the New 24,\" which feels like a time capsule full of vocoders, arpeggiated synths, and windswept drama. However, Moroder spends most of DÃ©jÃ -Vu collaborating with 21st century pop singers. The album comes closest to greatness on \"Back and Forth,\" where Kelis' commanding, just-gritty-enough vocals help Moroder recapture and update the glamour and drama of his definitive work. \"Diamonds\" makes the most of Charli XCX's frothiness on one of the album's most inspired pairings, while Sia and Kylie Minogue's respective contributions on the soaring title track and crystalline disco-pop of \"Right Here, Right Now\" are just as entertaining. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "Brandon Flowers' solo debut, 2010's Flamingo, seemed to make the case that the line between a Killers album and a Flowers album was blurry at best. Largely a continuation of the anthemic Springsteen-influenced sound of the Killers' 2006 effort Sam's Town, Flamingo also revealed Flowers' inclination toward glossy, synth-heavy, '80s adult-contemporary productions. For his sophomore solo outing, 2015's The Desired Effect, the line between the man and his band begins to sharpen. Produced by Ariel Rechtshaid (Madonna, Vampire Weekend, HAIM), the album finally finds Flowers achieving an unmistakable sound of his own, with the kind of effortless sophistication that a seasoned musician hopes for. Flowers long ago expanded his musical palette from the Killers' early, Duran Duran-influenced brand of dance-rock, but he's also become much more adept at combining his disparate musical influences and poetic narratives into a cohesive, emotionally resonant approach to expansive pop songwriting. As always, these are catchy, synth heavy songs punctuated by twangy guitar lines and Flowers' trademark lyrical themes, including: emotional turning points in long term relationships, lost souls seeking redemption, and of course, his childhood growing up in Vegasâwhich is particularly evident on the fittingly titled \"Way It's Always Been.\" He sings, \"They shut down the Golden Sahara Hotel/ Jessica says it won't be long til they blow it all to hell/ She's standing in the front yard, cut-offs and skin/ Me and her brother we been friends, since I can't remember when/ Ain't that the way that it's always been?/ Everybody sitting 'round waiting for the son to come again.\" Elsewhere, Flowers launches into an '80s take on Spector-style wall-of-synth-sound on \"Dreams Come True,\" and mashes up John Fogerty, ELO and Dire Straits on the Roy Orbison-style rock & roll number \"Digging Up the Heart.\" The genius thing about all this is that Flowers doesn't steal Jeff Lynne's hooks or ape Mark Knopfler's guitar sound (well, not exactly), he just imbues his productions with a distinct level of tangible homage. In fact, he's so specific in his aural fixations that you can almost pick out the songs he was listening to when working on a given track. On \"Can't Deny My Love,\" you can almost picture him starting out with the Latin synth-percussion from Madonna's \"La Isla Bonita,\" then bringing in the brittle guitar of Bryan Ferry's \"Don't Stop the Dance,\" before finally punching up the transitions with the percussive synth beats from Neneh Cherry's \"Buffalo Stance.\" And this isn't meant to make Flowers sound derivative. On the contrary, these points of inspiration exist in a sea of original material. Flowers even brings on board a handful of special guests, like Pet Shop Boys' Neil Tennant, on the Giorgio Moroder-esque disco tune \"I Can Change,\" and Bruce Hornsby on the earnest ballad \"Between Me and You.\" These choices work to underline the stylistic touchstones on the album. They also undercut any accusations of derivativeness by openly acknowledging his progenitors. And in the end, we're lucky he was so inspired by them, if the result is an album this solid. ~ Matt Collar",

        "summary": "If Don Henley was the sole member of the Eagles underrepresented on their debut album, Eagles, with only two lead vocals and one co-songwriting credit, he made up for it on their follow-up, the \"concept\" album Desperado. The concept had to do with Old West outlaws, but it had no specific narrative. On Eagles, the group had already begun to marry itself to a Southwest sound and lyrical references, from the Indian-style introduction of \"Witchy Woman\" to the Winslow, AZ, address in \"Take It Easy.\" All of this became more overt on Desperado, and it may be that Henley, who hailed from Northeast Texas, had the greatest affinity for the subject matter. In any case, he had co-writing credits on eight of the 11 selections and sang such key tracks as \"Doolin-Dalton\" and the title song. What would become recognizable as Henley's lyrical touch was apparent on those songs, which bore a serious, world-weary tone. Henley had begun co-writing with Glenn Frey, and they contributed the album's strongest material, which included the first single, \"Tequila Sunrise,\" and \"Desperado\" (strangely never released as a single). But where Eagles seemed deliberately to balance the band's many musical styles and the talents of the band's members, Desperado, despite its overarching theme, often seemed a collection of disparate tracks -- \"Out of Control\" was a raucous rocker, while \"Desperado\" was a painfully slow ballad backed by strings -- with other bandmembers' contributions tacked on rather than integrated. Randy Meisner was down to two co-writing credits and one lead vocal (\"Certain Kind of Fool\"), while Bernie Leadon's two songs, \"Twenty-One\" and \"Bitter Creek,\" seemed to come from a different record entirely. The result was an album that was simultaneously more ambitious and serious-minded than its predecessor and also slighter and less consistent. ~ William Ruhlmann",

        "summary": "Midnight Oil frontman Peter Garrett has long been active in elective politics in Australia, and like any good politician, he knows that sometimes the most important thing is to get your message out to the masses, even it means speaking with a bit less force than might be your custom. While the hard edges and challenging angles of 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and Red Sails in the Sunset made Midnight Oil bona fide superstars in Australia, they were little more than a rumor in most of the rest of the world, and for their sixth album, Diesel and Dust, Midnight Oil made some changes in their approach. On Diesel and Dust, there's less in the way of bruising hard rock like \"Best of Both Worlds,\" nothing as eccentric as \"Outside World,\" and very little as esoterically regional as \"Jimmy Sharman's Boxers,\" while the production favors the tuneful side of the band's songwriting (which, truth to tell, was always there) and buffs away some of the group's harsher edges. As a result, Diesel and Dust isn't an album for hardcore Oils fans, but as a bid for a larger audience, it was both shrewd and well executed -- it was the group's first real worldwide success, going platinum in America and spawning a massive hit single, \"Beds Are Burning.\" While the album lacks the kick-in-the-head impact of their earlier work, Diesel and Dust also makes clear that the bandmembers could apply their intelligence and passion to less aggressive material and still come up with forceful, compelling music, as on the haunting \"The Dead Heart\" and the poppy but emphatic \"Dreamworld.\" And as always, there was no compromise in the band's forceful political stance -- most of the album's songs deal openly with the issues of Aboriginal rights (hardly an issue pertinent only to Australians), and one of Midnight Oil's greatest victories may well be writing a song explicitly demanding reparations for indigenous peoples, and seeing it top the charts around the world. And the closer, \"Sometimes,\" may be the finest and most moving anthem the band ever wrote (\"Sometimes you're beaten to the core/Sometimes you're taken to the wall/But you don't give in\"). Diesel and Dust is that rarity, a bid for the larger audience that's also an artistic success and a triumph for leftist politics -- even the Clash never managed that hat trick this well.

Elsewhere on the disc there was, of note, \"Last Train to London\" and \"Confusion.\" Though Discovery charted well, it was becoming obvious that ELO were starting to run themselves out of useful Beatles hooks with which to fuel their hit-making machine. ~ James Chrispell",

        "summary": "AgesandAges took their time working on this follow-up to their joyous 2011 debut Alright You Restless, and despite the loss of close friends and family members, the band -- led by Tim Perry -- found that the best way to combat the darkness was through their celebratory, affirming music. What underlies the handclaps and radiant melodies on their sophomore album Divisionary are songs that noticeably delve deeper into philosophical and darker themes than the wide-eyed optimism that engulfed their debut, and marks the evolution the band have undergone. Still, ever the optimist, Perry's lyrics often end up dealing with letting go of painful memories by taking a step back and trying to move on as they sing together \"â¦and the weight that we left behind/we're all better off without it\" on \"The Weight Below.\" The outfit is made up of seven musicians, all of whom sing, and they waste no time delivering their wonderful multi-part vocals on opener \"Light Goes Out.\" It's an obvious statement of intent, and one that sets the tone for the uplifting sound that takes over the majority of the album. The group vocals at times nod to the call-and-response techniques found in gospel music, as on the worldly sounding \"Over It,\" while there are more indie-inspired moments on the breezy, country-tinged \"I See More.\" Still evident here is the exuberance that AgesandAges bring to their music, but this time around, a sense of melancholy and drama sits alongside their soaring pop sensibilities and anthemic choruses, with \"Calamity Is Overrated\" bringing some welcomed respite from the exultation and a brief moment of reflection after the joyful moments that precede it. The title track and album ender closes the record perfectly with Perry questioning the inner struggles that everybody experiences on a daily basis, and asks purely to \"do the right thing.\" This is the message that AgesandAges want everybody to take away from listening to their music, and for the most part, Divisionary is likely to succeed in that.

        "summary": "\"Name\" changed the game for the Goo Goo Dolls. Prior to that unexpected hit ballad, the Buffalo trio was pretty much content to turn out amiably sloppy rock & roll in the style of the Replacements. Like the latter-day 'Mats, they weren't adverse to cleaning up their sound a little bit, but once they had a hit, they were happy to jump headfirst into the mainstream, cleaning up their rockers until they shone and embracing acoustic power ballads instead of shunning them. In fact, \"Iris\" -- their contribution to the City of Angels soundtrack and lead single for their sixth album, Dizzy Up the Girl -- is a virtual rewrite of \"Name.\" The funny thing is, where most college rock bands of the Bush era sounded awkward as mainstream rockers, the Goo Goo Dolls actually sound better as a mainstream band, partially because they were hardly underground in the first place. Like a less mannered and conflicted Let Your Dim Light Shine-era Soul Asylum, the trio balances hard rockers with ballads. The difference is, they enjoy the mainstreaming of their music and respond with one of their catchiest sets of songs. There's nothing new on the record apart from their willingness to polish their music so it reaches the widest audience. That will alienate whatever hardcore followers they have left, but that attitude will likely please anyone brought aboard with \"Name\" and \"Iris.\" [Dizzy Up the Girl was re-released on LP in 2015.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "After 1988's brilliant but abrasive Surfer Rosa, the Pixies' sound couldn't get much more extreme. On Doolittle, they reined in the noise in favor of pop songcraft and accessibility. Producer Gil Norton's sonic sheen adds some polish, but Black Francis' tighter songwriting focuses the group's attack. Doolittle's most ferocious moments, like \"Dead,\" a visceral retelling of David and Bathsheba's affair -- are more stylized than the group's past outbursts. Meanwhile, the band's poppy side surfaces on the irresistible single \"Here Comes Your Man\" and the sweetly surreal love song \"La La Love You.\" The Pixies mix their arty weirdness with just enough hooks to produce gleefully demented singles like \"Debaser\" -- inspired by BuÃ±uel's classic surrealist short Un Chien Andalou -- and \"Wave of Mutilation,\" their surfy ode to driving a car into the sea. Though Doolittle's sound is cleaner and smoother than the Pixies' earlier albums, there are still plenty of weird, abrasive vignettes: the blankly psychotic \"There Goes My Gun,\" \"Crackity Jones,\" a song about a crazy roommate Francis had in Puerto Rico, and the nihilistic finale \"Gouge Away.\" Meanwhile, \"Tame\" and \"I Bleed\" continue the band's penchant for cryptic kink. But the album doesn't just refine the Pixies' sound; they also expand their range on the brooding, wannabe spaghetti Western theme \"Silver\" and the strangely theatrical \"Mr. Grieves.\" \"Hey\" and \"Monkey Gone to Heaven,\" on the other hand, stretch Francis' lyrical horizons: \"Monkey\"'s elliptical environmentalism and \"Hey\"'s twisted longing are the Pixies' versions of message songs and romantic ballads. Their most accessible album, Doolittle's wide-ranging moods and sounds make it one of their most eclectic and ambitious. A fun, freaky alternative to most other late-'80s college rock, it's easy to see why the album made the Pixies into underground rock stars. [In 2014, Doolittle 25 celebrated the album's quarter-century anniversary with generous bonus features, including Peel Sessions, B-sides, and demos for all of the songs from the Doolittle era. While many of the extra tracks here were available either on bootlegs or on previous official releases, the way Doolittle 25 collects them makes it a fascinating, satisfying listen for Pixies geeks.] ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "Only three years passed between the Stonesâ debut and this follow-up record, but the siblings seem to have aged exponentially in the interim. While 2007âs A Book Like This found the two setting their own adolescence to a soundtrack of acoustic guitars and sparse percussion, Down the Way is a decidedly adult album, filled with textured arrangements and a wider array of influences. Angus and Julia handle their own production this time around, and the resulting songs jump from panoramic chamber pop -- often with a rootsy, Americana edge -- to bedroom folk songs, with both members trading off vocals and instrumental duties. Julia still sings in a soft, fairy tale voice, but her own songs are bolder than they once were, with tracks like âHold Onâ taking much of their strength from the contrast between her gauzy, childlike croon and the nocturnal-sounding instruments that surround it. Even so, brother Angus gets the âmost improvedâ award, having moved past the solo folk songs he favored on A Book Like This (although some of those show up here, too) in favor of lush, collaborative material. On âDraw Your Swords,â one of the albumâs three tunes to stretch past six minutes, he rips into the final refrain with gusto, shouting the lyrics in a cracked baritone before adopting a Jeff Buckley-ish falsetto. Down the Way may be a bit long by 2010âs standards -- there are 13 tracks here, none of which is particularly short -- but the songs are solid throughout. ~ Andrew Leahey",

        "summary": "The debut full-length album from Australian dance music production duo Flight Facilities, 2014's Down to Earth showcases the groupâs sexy and atmospheric soft focus electronica. Showcasing the talents of members Hugo Gruzman and James Lyell, Down to Earth comes four years after their break-out single -- the yearning, '70s-influenced, electro-twee ballad \"Crave You\" featuring vocalist Giselle Rosselli -- caught the public's attention. \"Crave You\" is included here (along with a brief a cappella version of the song sung by Kylie Minogue) and serves as a good indication of what to expect from the duo's other material here. This is sultry, artfully curated, electronic pop that flows with deft ease through such stylistic touchstones as buoyant '70s soul (\"Sunshine\" featuring Reggie Watts), '90s ambient house (\"Apollo\" featuring Katie Noonan), and layered, early-2000s electronic-folk (\"Clair de Lune\" featuring Christine Hoberg). There is even a subtle concept-album quality to Down to Earth, replete with a spoken word intro and various samples (including a portion of Rod Serling's infamous 1959 CBS Mike Wallace interview) all designed to help guide you through your aural flight experience. With Down to Earth, Flight Facilities ultimately ground their music with thoughtful, emotionally resonant lyrics, distinctive vocals, and layered, sophisticated production, and by doing so, manage to rise above all expectations. ~ Matt Collar",

Greatly influenced by Zep, Heart did its part to help open doors for ladies of loudness with the excellent Dreamboat Annie. Aggressive yet melodic rockers like \"Sing Child,\" \"White Lightning & Wine,\" and the rock radio staples \"Magic Man\" and \"Crazy on You\" led to the tag \"the female Led Zeppelin.\" And in fact, Robert Plant did have a strong influence on Ann Wilson. But those numbers and caressing, folk-ish ballads like \"How Deep It Goes\" and the title song also make it clear that the Nancy and Ann Wilson had their own identity and vision early on.

        "summary": "The Whitest Boy Alive no doubt intend their moniker facetiously, if not a bit self-mockingly, but it's a useful cue in pinpointing their music, which does in fact display many qualities frequently associated with whiteness. Fortunately, unfunkiness is not primary among them. Splitting the unlikely but not insurmountable distance between the hushed acoustic folk-pop of Kings of Convenience, Erlend Ãye's previous main concern, and the stylish electronic dance-pop of his solo work, TWBA set their sights on gently grooving indie rock/pop, achieved through essentially non-electronic means (guitar, bass, drums, and the occasional electric piano.) Their grooves may not be particularly soulful, but they're toe-tapping enough, and very smartly performed, with an interlocking crispness that recalls Phoenix or perhaps a much less twitchy version of early Talking Heads. That smoothness and precision -- in rhythmic execution, instrumental tone, lyrical diction, and overall sound -- is, for better or worse, Dreams' most notable feature. Call it sonic purity and aesthetic clarity, or call it smarmy slickness and stuffy sterility; it's a pretty white sound either way you take it. But however polite or uptight it may be, pop music floats or fails on the strength of the songs, which in this case are frustratingly hit or miss. There are a handful of winners here -- the peppy kick-off \"Burning,\" the jumpy quasi-dance-punk of \"Fireworks,\"the brooding \"Done with You\" and the sweet, hesitantly self-affirming \"Don't Give Up\" -- and they are gleaming. Too much of the remainder of the album, though, lags in too-similar, blandly vanilla territory; less white hot than white bread. ~ K. Ross Hoffman",

        "summary": "Balance is the key element of the Eagles' self-titled debut album, a collection that contains elements of rock & roll, folk, and country, overlaid by vocal harmonies alternately suggestive of doo wop, the Beach Boys, and the Everly Brothers. If the group kicks up its heels on rockers like \"Chug All Night,\" \"Nightingale,\" and \"Tryin',\" it is equally convincing on ballads like \"Most of Us Are Sad\" and \"Train Leaves Here This Morning.\" The album is also balanced among its members, who trade off on lead vocal chores and divide the songwriting such that Glenn Frey, Bernie Leadon, and Randy Meisner all get three writing or co-writing credits. (Fourth member Don Henley, with only one co-writing credit and two lead vocals, falls a little behind, while Jackson Browne, Gene Clark, and Jack Tempchin also figure in the writing credits.) The album's overall balance is worth keeping in mind because it produced three Top 40 hit singles (all of which turned up on the massively popular Eagles: Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975) that do not reflect that balance. \"Take It Easy\" and \"Peaceful Easy Feeling\" are similar-sounding mid-tempo folk-rock tunes sung by Frey that express the same sort of laid-back philosophy, as indicated by the word \"easy\" in both titles, while \"Witchy Woman,\" a Henley vocal and co-composition, initiates the band's career-long examination of supernaturally evil females. These are the songs one remembers from Eagles, and they look forward to the eventual dominance of the band by Frey and Henley. But the complete album from which they come belongs as much to Leadon's country-steeped playing and singing and to Meisner's melodic rock & roll feel, which, on the release date, made it seem a more varied and consistent effort than it did later, when the singles had become overly familiar. [Eagles was released as an OGV LP in 2014.] ~ William Ruhlmann",

        "summary": "Described as a 19-track collection of \"musical postcards\" inspired by travel across the United States, Bill Baird's Earth into Aether is a thematic selection of material from across the eclectic musician's post-Sound Team solo output, including that of his quasi-band moniker Sunset. Adhering to themes of travel, arrivals, and departures, it delves into the songwriter's more affectionate, romantic terrain while still representing his typical mÃ©lange of styles, touching on psychedelic pop, country, and electronica, all under an umbrella of melodic lo-fi. Highlights include the trippy, organ- and delay-suffused \"Your Dark Sunglasses Won't Make You Lou Reed\" (\"or even Doug Yule\") and the infectious, guitar- and horns-fortified \"24 Karat Soul.\" Melodic bass and clattering xylophones give way to growling electronics on \"Spring Break of the Soul.\" Elsewhere, marrying the wistful and the wry (\"You're leaving me, but it makes me kind of glad\"), \"We'll Meet Again Someday, or We Won't\" is a plainspoken acoustic guitar serenade. The unexpectedly strings-led \"Surfing\" is one of three varied instrumentals on the album, while fuzzed-out guitar and punky drums define \"Captain Brain.\" Given the spotty availability of Baird's prior releases, some of which were exclusive to one format and then only temporarily, Earth into Aether is an opportune entrance point for those new to the artist, doubling as a well-curated playlist for established fans. ~ Marcy Donelson",

        "summary": "Calexico have had a chiaroscuro career: after each of the band's more somber efforts, they tend to return with something lighthearted. Such is the case with Edge of the Sun: arriving after Algiers' journey into New Orleans noir, it feels like a working holiday -- probably because it was close to one, with Joey Burns, John Convertino, and company spending ten days in CoyoacÃ¡n, a Mexico City borough, for inspiration (later on, they recorded in Los Angeles and Athens, among other locales). Despite its Mexican beginnings, Edge of the Sun often tips toward Calexico's affable Americana, with particular success on \"Falling from the Sky\"'s tumbleweed pop and on the gently insistent \"Tapping on the Line,\" which is elevated by Neko Case's clarion vocals. On these tracks, Edge of the Sun recalls Garden Ruin and Feast of Wire, although the latter album negotiated its sonic and emotional twists with more drama. It's almost as though these songs are so sunwashed that they just can't be truly dark, even when the band tries its hardest. \"Beneath the City of Dreams,\" a tale full of dealers and getaway cars, might have had more heft if it had appeared on Algiers or Carried to Dust, although Gaby Moreno's cameos almost get it there; similarly, the \"days of sorrow\" referred to on \"Moon Never Rises\" feel distant, not recent. On the other hand, the gentle melancholy of \"Follow the River\" and the squinty-eyed, implosive \"Bullets & Rocks\" feel genuine. As always, Edge of the Sun is beautifully crafted, from the gorgeous arrangements and chord changes on \"CoyoacÃ¡n\" and \"Woodshed Waltz\" to \"Miles from the Sea\"'s poignant lyrics, which fall somewhere between a short story and a lullaby. Still, it's hard to shake the feeling that this album is a little perfunctory compared to what came before it, and at times, it's predictable: \"When the Angels Played\" is the kind of dusty, strummy song that sounds like it should have a harmonica solo -- and sure enough, it does. It's notable that Edge of the Sun's brightest highlight is \"Cumbia de Donde,\" a celebration of the footloose life. As pleasant as the album is, this time it feels like Calexico are just passing through. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "Elliott Smith's third album sees his one-man show getting a little more ambitious. While he still plays all the instruments himself, he plays more of them. Several of the songs mimic the melody mastery of pop bands from 1960s. The most alluring numbers, however, are still his quietly melancholy acoustic ones. While the full-band songs are catchy and smart, Smith's recording equipment isn't quite up to the standards set by the Beatles and the Beach Boys. The humbler arrangements are better suited to the sparse equipment. \"Between the Bars,\" for example, plays Smith's strengths perfectly. He sings, in his endearingly limited whisper, of late-night drinking and introspection, and his subdued strumming creates a minor-key mood befitting the mysteries of self. \"Angeles\" is equally ethereal -- Smith's acoustic fingerpicking spins out notes which briskly move around a single atmospheric keyboard chord, like aural minnows swimming toward a solitary light at the surface of the water. The lyrics are a darkly biting rejection of the hypercapitalist dream machinery of Los Angeles (it would make a great theme song for Smith's label, Kill Rock Stars). Ironically, \"Angeles\" was included on the Good Will Hunting soundtrack, which won Smith the acclaim of Hollywood's biggest, brightest, and best connected voting body, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences. Smith's stock in L.A. soared after he took his bow at the Oscars with Celine Dion and Trisha Yearwood. It might have been more interesting had he sung \"Angeles.\" ~ Darryl Cater",

        "summary": "Any Compost act willing to title a debut album Elevator Music is either being self-deprecating or not very smart -- unless, of course, the title references an aim to lift the listener's spirits. Regardless, it's a dicey move, and since Elevator Music is an album released on Compost, there's bound to be at least a couple moments that are deserving of such a categorization. This is no exception, but there's room for a little bit of everything throughout the course of this extremely lengthy album, whether one is talking about levels of quality or stylistic shifts. This full-length from Rainer TrÃ¼by and company has been a long time coming, evidenced by the inclusion of the 1999 single \"A Go Go\" and an update of the similarly dusty \"Alegre.\" In a sense, it's unfortunate this album came so late, since dance albums with heavy-handed Brazilian fusioneering had become such a beyond-tiresome thing by 2003. Some of this material originated before the overload, so it's hard to knock them for it, even though -- as prominent, established figureheads of the scene -- they were partly responsible for the glut. Besides, there's more to the album than that. \"Universal Love,\" with a big fat swipe from L.T.D.'s Mizells-produced \"Love to the World,\" sets the breezy, carefree tone that drifts throughout the album. \"Runnin',\" one of two tracks featuring vocalist Wunmi (see also Bugz in the Attic's \"Zombie\"), is a particularly breathless Afro-beat/broken-beat hybrid. Like a lot of its peers, TrÃ¼by Trio is too anxious to show off all the group's facets on one disc. The best moments here are in danger of being washed out by the sheer quantity of content, a fair portion of which fails to stimulate. ~ Andy Kellman",

        "summary": "As a suburban Californian kid, DJ Shadow tended to treat hip-hop as a musical innovation, not as an explicit social protest, which goes a long way toward explaining why his debut album Endtroducing... sounded like nothing else at the time of its release. Using hip-hop, not only its rhythms but its cut-and-paste techniques, as a foundation, Shadow created a deep, endlessly intriguing world on Endtroducing, one where there are no musical genres, only shifting sonic textures and styles. Shadow created the entire album from samples, almost all pulled from obscure, forgotten vinyl, and the effect is that of a hazy, half-familiar dream -- parts of the record sound familiar, yet it's clear that it only suggests music you've heard before, and that the multi-layered samples and genres create something new. And that's one of the keys to the success of Endtroducing -- it's innovative, but it builds on a solid historical foundation, giving it a rich, multi-faceted sound. It's not only a major breakthrough for hip-hop and electronica, but for pop music. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Escape was a groundbreaking album for San Francisco's Journey, charting three singles inside Billboard's Top Ten, with \"Don't Stop Believing\" reaching number nine, \"Who's Crying Now\" number four, and \"Open Arms\" peaking at number two and holding there for six weeks. Escape flung Journey steadfastly into the AOR arena, combining Neal Schon's grand yet palatable guitar playing with Jonathan Cain's blatant keyboards. All this was topped off by the passionate, wide-ranged vocals of Steve Perry, who is the true lifeblood of this album, and this band. The songs on Escape are more rock-flavored, with more hooks and a harder cadence compared to their former sound. \"Who's Crying Now\" spotlights the sweeping fervor of Perry's voice, whose theme about the ups and downs of a relationship was plentiful in Journey's repertoire. With \"Don't Stop Believing,\" the whisper of Perry's ardor is crept up to with Schon's searing electric guitar work, making for a perfect rock song. One of rock's most beautiful ballads, \"Open Arms,\" gleams with an honesty and feel only Steve Perry could muster. Outside of the singles, there is a certain electricity that circulates through the rest of the album. The songs are timeless, and as a whole, they have a way of rekindling the innocence of youthful romance and the rebelliousness of growing up, built from heartfelt songwriting and sturdy musicianship. ~ Mike DeGagne",

        "summary": "The seventh studio long-player from the affable, East Coast alt-rock veterans, Evermotion retains the soaring melodicism and on-the-nose (in a good way) pop architecture of Guster's earlier work, but the band has come a long way from its college rock-ready acoustic guitar- and hand percussion-led beginnings. Bolstered by layers of sequencers, breezy synth pads, and cavernous harmonies, the 11-track set, which was produced by musical polymath Richard Swift (the Shins, Damien Jurado, Foxygen), goes out of its way to separate itself, at least sonically, from prior outings, but Guster's penchant for blending stadium-ready Brit-pop grandeur with proletarian American trad rock guitar noodling ultimately wins out -- much like the Shins' Port of Morrow, which adopted a similar electro-pop sheen, it's comfort food disguised as haute cuisine; it also feels a little late to the party. That said, the band is too talented a pop-making machine to unleash a complete dud, and standout cuts like the propulsive first single \"Simple Machine,\" the breezy, north country rambler \"Never Coming Down,\" and the sumptuous opener \"Long Night\" -- the latter of which skillfully pairs the infectious, circular gait of the Beta Band's \"Dry the Rain\" with the icy expansiveness of Coldplay's \"Clocks\" -- engage on nearly every level. The remaining tracks are nowhere near unlistenable, they're just largely ephemeral. Kudos to the group for deciding to do a little remodeling, but it might behoove them to keep the original floor plans, as the current arrangement feels a little out of character.

        "parentTitle": "Damon Albarn",
        "summary": "If there ever were a modern rock star who could be called an auteur, it'd be Damon Albarn. As the leader of Blur, he was responsible for the group's grand themes, taking credit for the birth of Brit-pop circa 1993's Modern Life Is Rubbish, but his signature -- a sly, theatrical blend of melodic post-punk and new wave undercut by electronic exoticism and a thirst for world music -- grew ever more distinctive in the projects he pursued after the group's 2003 dissolution, surfacing in the dystopian future of Gorillaz and the glum present of the Good, the Bad & the Queen. He didn't hide within a collective so much as embrace collaboration, using other musicians to accelerate exploration, with all the different musicians underscoring his own world-view. Albarn is not without a collaborator on Everyday Robots, his first official pop solo album (he released the experimental opera Dr. Dee under his own name in 2012). He's produced by Richard Russell, the head of XL Records, and Damon's co-producer on Bobby Womack's 2012 comeback The Bravest Man in the Universe, a sparse electronic soul album that shares some skeletal characteristics with Everyday Robots. Russell assists Albarn in shaping Everyday Robots into a quiet, contemplative extended meditation on modernity and the past, a record that seems personal but stops just short of confessional. \"Hollow Ponds,\" which intercuts pivotal vignettes from throughout his life, acts as the autobiographical centerpiece but often the lyrics that stick depict the isolation of modern technology, the \"everyday robots on our phones\" who press play when they're lonely. Underneath this high-tech alienation, what's left unspoken is how Albarn and Russell are hardly Luddites. Everyday Robots embraces modern technology -- its rhythms are digitized, electronic instruments are interwoven with acoustics, spoken samples are deployed strategically -- which doesn't undercut Albarn's disconnection thesis so much as underscore his resignation at existing in the fractured present. This is the key dichotomy of the album; its surfaces are Spartan, its tempos slow and measured -- it quickens its step only at \"Mister Tembo,\" a joyous ode to the birth of an elephant -- but it's a soulful album, not chilly. Its sadness is a warm, enveloping melancholy that harks back to the floating psychedelic dissociation of \"This Is a Low\" while touching upon the digital desolation of Demon Days. Upon repeated listens, the sorrowful undertow of Everyday Robots becomes a comfort, a balm for moments of alienation; it's the kind of record that when you're lonely, you press play.

        "summary": "Recorded in London following an attempt on his life, Exodus shows Bob Marley mellowing a bit. Despite some powerful political tracks, Marley adopts a less fiery, more reflective approach than his previous outings. Still, it's hard to find reggae as good as this. Exodus has all one would expect from a Bob Marley album: rumbling statements like \"Exodus\" and \"The Heathen\" as well as poetic love songs like \"Turn Your Lights Down Low.\" Considering how good these tracks are, Exodus does not stop here. Marley also unleashed the huge international hits \"Jamming,\" \"Waiting in Vain,\" and \"One Love/People Get Ready.\" These inspired tracks, perhaps more than any others, came to define Marley around the world. They are irresistible no matter how many times they are played. Never one to dodge innovation, \"Exodus\" hints that Marley was taking cues from the emerging dub scene. Exodus, even though it contains some of Marley's best work, has an underlying nostalgic feel to it, hinting that Marley was getting a little formulaic.

        "summary": "The anthemic indie rock sound of Snow Patrol provides a bit of hope and promise among the many acts attempting to fit into a certain genre or scene. Snow Patrol belongs to their own scene, and their third album, 2004's Final Straw, proved that with several global hit singles such as \"Run,\" \"Chocolate,\" \"How to Be Dead,\" and the reissue of \"Spitting Games.\" British fans once more proclaimed their beloved Snow Patrol as a true rock & roll band while American audiences finally took notice of the Scottish collective. The band's fourth album, Eyes Open, doesn't fall short from where they left off; in fact, Snow Patrol's hungry rock sound only gets bigger and better this time around. All guitar hooks and singalong choruses are firmly in place. Gary Lightbody is an underrated frontman. On Eyes Open, he once again writes songs that are from the heart and true to self-reflection without getting too sappy and too overjoyed. From the playful name-dropping of Sufjan Stevens on \"Hands Open\" to their passionate delivery on \"It's Beginning to Get to Me\" and \"Shut Your Eyes,\" Snow Patrol's approach is epic. They are the kind of band that embraces simplicity as beautiful and human flaws as art. The lullaby-like \"You Could Be Happy\" and the passionate buildup of \"Make This Go on Forever\" are evident of that. This 11-song set is a masterpiece, so keep your ears and eyes open for Snow Patrol. They're onto something big. ~ MacKenzie Wilson",

        "summary": "The Black Eyed Peas make effective pop/crossover music, but with all the limitations of the form -- vapid lyrics, clumsy delivery, vocals smoothed over by Auto-Tune, and songwriting that constantly strains for (and reaches) the lowest common denominator. Worse yet, they aren't content to be disposable pop stars; they also want to write anthemic, vital songs that speak for a new generation. And so comes The E.N.D. (Energy Never Dies). For every hyper-sexualized, by-the-numbers track like the hit single \"Boom Boom Pow,\" there are message songs like \"Now Generation,\" which begins, in cheerleader fashion, with the lines: \"We are the now generation! We are the generation now!/This is the now generation! This is the generation now!\" Led by will.i.am's production, which is continually the best thing about the album, the Black Eyed Peas move even farther away from hip-hop into the type of blandly inspirational dance-pop that has become ripe for advertising and marketing opportunities, including \"I Gotta Feeling\" (\"I gotta feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night\") and \"Party All Night\" (\"If we could party all night and sleep all day, and throw all of our problems away, my life would be ea-say\"). There's also a call for unity titled \"One Tribe,\" which gradually descends into confusion -- and nearly self-parody -- with a line about the dangers of making enemies, rapped this way: \"If I had an enemy, then my enemy's gonna try to come kill me 'cuz I'm his enemy -- one tribe y'all.\" Between tracks, there are also occasional cameos from a narrator, who sounds strangely like Star Trek's Worf, intoning nuggets like these: \"There is no longer a physical record store, but we will continue to let the beat rock!\" and \"The most powerful force on the planet is the energy of the youth/But when this powerful youth becomes activated and stimulated and collectively decides not to buy things, what will happen to the economy?\" Granted, there's nothing here as embarrassing as \"My Humps,\" and the production is a shade better than previous material from the group or Fergie solo (although still not as good as will.i.am solo ventures), but The E.N.D. (Energy Never Dies) is a mess of pop/dance/rap crossover. It certainly won't change the minds of everyone who thinks that the group's pandering approach and clumsy execution make it the worst thing about pop music in the 2000s. ~ John Bush",

        "summary": "Regina Spektor worked with no less than four big-name producers on Far, all of them with very different backgrounds: David Kahne was her collaborator on 2006's Begin to Hope; Garret \"Jacknife\" Lee counts R.E.M. and U2 among his credits; Jeff Lynne's lavish sound is famous on ELO's albums; and Mike Elizondo has worked with Fiona Apple and Maroon 5. It's something of a surprise, then, that Far sounds so homogenized. On Soviet Kitsch and Begin to Hope, Spektor's wide-eyed moments were balanced with darker, knowing songs that kept her music grounded. Here, almost all of the rough or unpredictable edges have been smoothed away, and all that's left is Spektor's sweet, quirky side. At times, Far gets close to being unbearably precious, whether it's putting Spektor's name in all lowercase letters in the liner notes, her dolphin on the otherwise charming \"Folding Chair,\" or lyrics like \"We made our own computer out of macaroni pieces\" on the chirpy opener, \"The Calculation.\" Even the album's darker tracks, such as the percussion-heavy \"Machine,\" are surprisingly sugary compared to her previous work. However, Spektor's guileless voice and delivery allow her to get away with sounds and ideas that would be horribly cloying in the hands of almost any other artist. She manages to make a song with the chorus \"Eet, eet, eet\" catchy and affecting, and fashions an observant and witty story out of returning a wallet to Blockbuster Video. Still, Far's best moments occur when Spektor turns down the whimsy a few notches. It's probably not a coincidence that the Kahne-produced \"Human of the Year\" shares some of Begin to Hope's intimacy and ambition, but \"Blue Lips\" and \"Man of a Thousand Faces\" also let Spektor's more mature -- but not overly serious -- side shine. Likewise, \"Two Birds\" and \"One More Time with Feeling\" show that she hasn't lost her touch for deceptively pretty pop with clever lyrics. While Far is far from bad, it doesn't quite live up to expectations, either, based on all the talent involved in making it and how fully Spektor expressed herself on Begin to Hope. [The CD/DVD version of Far includes two bonus tracks, \"Time Is All Around\" and \"The Sword & the Pen,\" that are at least the equal of the songs that made it on the regular version of Far, as well as videos for \"Laughing With,\" \"Dance Anthem of the 80's,\" and \"Man of a Thousand Faces.\"] ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "Dr. Dog have been steadily refining their sound since the unexpected success of Easy Beat, and Fate continues that trend. They've still got all the right classic rock moves, clever production ideas, and the ragged-but-right vocals and bouncy bass of Toby Leaman and Scott McMicken's tough guitar and sweet vocals. It sounds much like We All Belong, but this time out there are also some really nice string and horn arrangements and a bit more utilization of studio production. But a nice studio can be a double-edged sword. The songs sound great, but at times it seems that the detail and adornment are more important than the songs (most noticeably on the opener, which is nearly swallowed by backing vocals). The sound effects that link the songs and clumsy tape edits seem a tad forced (as if to replace some of the genuine weirdness on some of Easy Beat), and some of the titles and lyrical themes seem recycled from We All Belong. That being said, Fate is still a thoroughly enjoyable album from a fine band. ~ Sean Westergaard",

        "summary": "It may be far too obvious to even mention that Norah Jones' follow-up to her 18-million-unit-selling, eight-Grammy-winning, genre-bending, super-smash album Come Away with Me has perhaps a bit too much to live up to. But that's probably the biggest conundrum for Jones: having to follow up the phenomenal success of an album that was never designed to be so hugely popular in the first place. Come Away with Me was a little album by an unknown pianist/vocalist who attempted to mix jazz, country, and folk in an acoustic setting -- who knew? Feels Like Home could be seen as \"Come Away with Me Again\" if not for that fact that it's actually better. Smartly following the template forged by Jones and producer Arif Mardin, there is the intimate single \"Sunrise,\" some reworked cover tunes, some interesting originals, and one ostensible jazz standard. These are all good things, for also like its predecessor, Feels Like Home is a soft and amiable album that frames Jones' soft-focus Aretha Franklin voice with a group of songs that are as classy as they are quiet. Granted, not unlike the dippy albeit catchy hit \"Don't Know Why,\" they often portend deep thoughts but come off in the end more like heartfelt daydreams. Of course, Jones could sing the phone book and make it sound deep, and that's what's going to keep listeners coming back. \r\nWhat's surprising here are the bluesy, more jaunty songs that really dig into the country stylings only hinted at on Come Away with Me. To these ends, the infectious shuffle of \"What Am I to You?\" finds Jones truly coming into her own as a blues singer as well as a writer. Her voice has developed a spine-tingling breathy scratch that pulls on your ear as she rises to the chorus. Similarly, \"Toes\" and \"Carnival Town\" -- co-written by bassist Lee Alexander and Jones -- are pure '70s singer/songwriting that call to mind a mix of Rickie Lee Jones and k.d. lang. Throw in covers of Tom Waits and Townes Van Zandt along with Duke Ellington's \"Melancholia,\" retitled here \"Don't Miss You at All\" and featuring lyrics by Jones, and you've got an album so blessed with superb songwriting that Jones' vocals almost push the line into too much of a good thing. Thankfully, there is also a rawness and organic soulfulness in the production that's refreshing. No digital pitch correction was employed in the studio and you can sometimes catch Jones hitting an endearingly sour note. She also seems to be making good on her stated desire to remain a part of a band. Most all of her sidemen, who've worked with the likes of Tom Waits and Cassandra Wilson, get writing credits. It's a \"beauty and the beast\" style partnership that harks back to the best Brill Building-style intentions and makes for a quietly experimental and well-balanced album. ~ Matt Collar",

        "summary": "After 2012's lush Medicine Man, the Bamboos' de facto leader and chief songwriter Lance Ferguson decided to focus his attention on writing for the core group on Fever in the Road. Rather than a slew of guest vocalists, those chores have been equally divided between Kylie Auldist and Ella Thompson to excellent result; the group feels more like a touring unit than a studio construction. The basic sextet is appended by horns and strings in places, but the band's sound, though multi-textured, is more stripped and immediate. Co-produced by Ferguson and John Castle (who also worked on Medicine Man and plays guitar and other instruments), the real beauty of Fever in the Road is that virtually any track here is a potential single. Opener \"Avenger\" is the set's first. Fronted by Thompson, its rough-and tumble psych-pop is kissed by Baroque organ, spacey sunshine soul, and cracking drums, with a nice snare break tossed in for good measure. Auldist reveals the other side of the proposition with \"Rats,\" a garagey, rave-up soul number with a swaggering guitar line that engages in call-and-response with the singer on the verse. Organs, bells, and a trumpet buoy the explosive chorus pulsed by the drumkit. \"Your Lovin' Is Easy\" is slippery '60s pop performed by Thompson, Ferguson, and Castle. Its rock trope gets slipped by the Motown-esque chorus. Stax-era soul is evoked in the gospel groove on \"Truth,\" with Auldist in full, gritty wail pushed on by horns and strings. \"Harbinger\" is breezy, spacey pop. Thompson's breathy delivery is adorned by a tight, shuffling snare, two organs, guitars, pulsing bass, and shimmering violin and cello. \"Jump My Train\" is hard-strutting, B-3-drenched soul with clattering breaks, a thrumming bassline, and Auldist in full-throated scorch. The instruments, including punchy horns, electric piano, and chunky guitars, are put through just enough distortion to make it sound live. Fever in the Road presents the Bamboos as more electric and forceful on record. Though there is less production sheen here, great songs and energetic, truly inspired performances make them sound bigger and badder than ever. ~ Thom Jurek",

        "summary": "The British band Sniff 'n' the Tears' 1978 debut, Fickle Heart, is best known for containing the relentlessly catchy rocker \"Driver's Seat,\" which became a hit in 1979 and is simply one of the greatest one-hit wonder singles of that decade, and arguably of all time. Killer keyboard and synthesizer riffs by Alan Fealdman and guest Keith Miller, piercing electric guitars by Loz Netto and Mick Dyche, solid bass by Chris Birkin, steady drums by producer Luigi Salvoni, and bandleader/songwriter Paul Roberts' incessant acoustic rhythm guitar and dramatic lead vocals are all terrific individually, but they add up to a fantastic whole. \"Driver's Seat\" is the leadoff track on Fickle Heart and, while it's hard to follow up a classic tune, the album does have some other good songs that are also strong, melodic rock. Sniff 'n' the Tears is sometimes classified as a new wave band, but that's not really accurate. The occasional synthesizer bits spice up Sniff 'n' the Tears' music, but they don't dominate it. \"New Lines on Love\" and \"This Side of the Blue Horizon\" are both richly textured with various keyboards and guitars. \"The Thrill of It All\" has a dark and mysterious feel due to Roberts' sly vocal style. \"Looking for You\" isn't as brooding, and the warm keyboard solos are enjoyable. Roberts, an accomplished painter, created the lifelike, photograph-quality cover painting for Fickle Heart and the band's subsequent albums. However, Roberts dissolved the Fickle Heart lineup and formed an entirely new version of Sniff 'n' the Tears for 1980s Games Up. [This edition contains bonus tracks.] ~ Bret Adams",

        "summary": "With Final Straw, Snow Patrol mainman Gary Lightbody seems to take all the inspiration he's gathered from the superstar collaborators in his Reindeer Section project and bundle it into a series of earnest bombastic rock ballads. Producer Garrett Lee deserves credit up-front for expanding the band's sound even further from the lush symphonic grandeur of When It's All Over We Still Have to Clear Up. Here, Lightbody and his cohorts traverse the same anthemic territory as Idlewild, with guitars cranked to the max. But where his friend Roddy Woomble of Idlewild soars all over the map vocally, Lightbody prefers the immediate and somewhat indifferent vocal style of another friend, Aidan Moffat of Arab Strap. Indeed, much of Final Straw feels like a middle ground between these two bands, if not for the violins, xylophones, and percussion Lee layers into the mix. Thanks to extra ornamentation, \"Gleaming Auction\" steps into the swirling realm of Rollerskate Skinny, as wobbly dynamics add interest to punishing guitars. If one gets the sense that Lightbody is shuffling through influences, ranging from all of the above-mentioned bands to Radiohead, Coldplay (\"Somewhere a Clock Is Ticking\" seems to be a more rocking cousin to Coldplay's \"Clocks\"), and even Pink Floyd (on the unmistakably Dark Side of the Moon-influenced \"Same\"), his mastery of mood and adherence to harmonies make for a consistently coherent and compelling 40 minutes. Highlights include the throbbing cacophony that is \"Wow\" and \"Spitting Games,\" which seems like a cascading Wall of Sound feedback-free descendant of My Bloody Valentine. Final Straw is another strong slab of emotion and invigorating energy from a solid band that mixes its influences into an always heady sonic libation. ~ Tim DiGravina",

        "summary": "The sixth long player from the rootsy Australian trio (and first outing in four years) finds bandleader John Butler occupying a more introspective and nostalgic headspace than he has on previous outings. Butler has always been a cerebral gent, although one prone to crafting stadium sized activist anthems like \"Earthbound Child\" and \"Fire in the Sky,\" but there's a more settled vibe to Flesh + Blood that suggests a possible sea change. Opener \"Spring to Come,\" which begins with the lyric \"Lost my love, lost my light\" and concludes with the line \"After a lonely long night comes the sun,\" sets the mood, offering up a solid foundation of fluid fingerpicking and circular, warm weather rhythms and melodies for Butler to opine over. It's a tone and sentiment that occurs frequently throughout the album's surprisingly concise (for a jam band) fifty-two minute runtime, and it serves the trio well, especially on more contemplative cuts like \"Bullet Girl,\" \"Only One,\" and the lovely and languid Ainslie Wills-assisted \"Young and Wild.\" To be fair, JBT fans looking for bolder, more familiar strokes have more than a few traditional roots-rock offerings to sift through, some of them solid (the dark and immersive \"Cold Wind\" and the fun, if not a tad derivative \"Livin' in the City\") and some of them not (the turgid, reggae/blues-rock epic \"Blame it on Me\" and its throwaway, whitebread counterpart \"Devil Woman\"), but it's in the more refined, self reflective moments where Butler, bassist Byron Luiters, and drummer Nicky Bomba really come alive. ~ James Christopher Monger",

At its best, the album is effortlessly suave and charming -- \"Over You\" is one of their greatest singles, and \"Oh Yeah\" is nearly as persuasive -- but much of the record is devoted to ill-formed, stylish lounge-pop. In particular, the reliance on reworked covers of \"In the Midnight Hour\" and \"Eight Miles High\" is distressing, not only because it signals a lack of imagination, but also because it suggests that Flesh + Blood is simply a lesser solo effort from Bryan Ferry.

Although the album contains two of the group's finest singles in \"Birdhouse in Your Soul\" and \"Istanbul (Not Constantinople),\" the overall record is uneven, since the group's hooks aren't quite as sharp as before and the humor is either too geeky or leavened with awkward social statements like \"Your Racist Friend.\" Even with its faults, Flood has a number of first-rate songs, and it's a strong addition to their catalog, even if it isn't as weirdly intoxicating as its predecessors. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "parentTitle": "The Districts",
        "summary": "From their origins as a high-school band made good to their sound, which blends and balances slow-burning, folky anthems and brash rockers, the Districts could seem almost prefabricated if they weren't so genuine. On their impressive debut Telephone, they combined vivid storytelling and showstopping performances with an ease that felt like they'd been doing this their whole lives -- which in a way, they had been. Following in the footsteps of My Morning Jacket, the Replacements, and fellow Fat Possum artists the Walkmen and Cold War Kids, the Districts also manage to stay on the right side of the fine line separating classic from clichÃ©d on A Flourish and a Spoil. Featuring new guitarist Pat Cassidy (founding member Mark Larson left the band for college) and production by John Congleton, the Districts' second album reins in the jammy aspects of their music somewhat, giving their fury and poetry a little more form. The new songs on their self-titled EP hinted at this direction, but it feels more natural here. A Flourish and a Spoil's best moments sound refined instead of confined, and still leave plenty of room for their buildups and breakdowns. They expand on their endearingly scruffy rock on \"Peaches\" and \"4th and Roebling,\" which has a rough-and-tumble jangle that echoes the New York-based bands of the early 2000s (making the title's reference to a Brooklyn intersection all the more apt). Later, \"Suburban Smell\" draws its inspiration from the uglier side of the band's small-town roots, and as Rob Grote voices his disgust at a group of jocks picking on an intellectually disabled kid, he sounds younger and more vulnerable than he ever did on Telephone. At nearly nine minutes long, the standout \"Young Blood\" is the notable exception to A Flourish and a Spoil's more concise approach. As it grows from sunny strumming to searing feedback to the shout-along refrain \"It's a long way down from the top to the bottom/It's a long way back to the height from where I am,\" it reveals itself as the perfect mix of Telephone's emotional tides and Congleton's muscular production. Occasionally, the Districts sound less sure of themselves than they did on their debut; songs such as \"Hounds\" and \"Bold\" feel more hemmed-in than streamlined. Still, A Flourish and a Spoil is far from a sophomore slump; instead, it's a portrait of the Districts as they evolve from their freewheeling beginning. [A Flourish and a Spoil was also released on LP.] ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "For the Company is the full-length debut of brooding Australian indie folk trio Little May, former high school classmates who founded the group in 2012 and quickly found fans, headlining tour opportunities, and a record deal with Capitol. Produced by Aaron Dessner of indie rockers the National, the album adds light-handed electronics to the mix of fairly elaborate guitar work and warm vocal harmonies demonstrated on their contemplative eponymous EP. The tone of the LP remains serious with the particular songwriting quality of old souls. The regretful, slow jangle of \"Chemicals,\" for example, has lead singer Hannah Field wearily determine \"You're the closest thing I know to being homesick all the time\" and \"These strangers know you better now.\" \"Cicadas\" showcases their deft but dreamy guitars, accompanied by gentle strings, keys, bass, and drums, which together create a hushed urgency under subdued vocals. The quietly driving \"Oh My My\" features skipping drums, atmospheric piano and strings, and gently whirling Theremin-like effects for an equally unsettled hue. The whole album is comfortable like a favorite pair of sneakers on the floor next to a tear-stained pillow, without the lethargy; it hits a mid-range wistful tone and stays right there. It's a mood space that calls to mind the U.S.'s Lord Huron, with a sound that from time to time borders on dream pop (\"Seven Hours,\" \"Remind Me\"). The most uptempo song, \"Remind Me,\" is lush, full-on guitar rock with complementary drumming, and the album closes on the relatively uplifting \"The Shine Is Brighter at Night,\" but For the Company is ruled by rumination and atmospheric elegance. Not quite as catchy or harmony-rich as a few of their earliest songs, some of Little May's early adopters may be a little bummed out by the material, but many will find it hits a sweet spot between the heart and head in which to snugly settle. The digital download version contains two bonus tracks, 2015 remasters of \"Hide\" and \" Boardwalks\" from their debut EP. ~ Marcy Donelson",

        "summary": "If Forever for Now, the first album by modern singer/songwriter LP, sounds a bit too assured for a debut, there's a reason for that: like many overnight sensations, LP has paid her share of dues. Some of those dues came in quite prominent places, particularly Rihanna's 2011 single \"Cheers (Drink to That),\" which LP co-wrote, but she had been writing and recording independently for nearly a decade prior, a long history that can be felt in the craft of Forever for Now but never once heard among its 12 songs. Far from sounding like the fussy work of a professional songwriter, there's a sharp, stylish gleam to the very sound of Forever for Now, a combination of LP's savvy pop sensibility and the cool commercial instincts of Rob Cavallo, a producer best known for his work with Green Day, Goo Goo Dolls, and My Chemical Romance. Cavallo is a good fit for LP, for he accentuates and accessorizes the contours of her songs without diluting the eccentricities. He gives her plenty of space to roam, allowing her to soar as high as a skyscraper on \"Tokyo Sunrise\" and \"Salvation,\" but also knows when to keep things intimate, as on the haunting coda of the title track. What distinguishes LP is when she ties these two extremes together with dramatic flair, as she does in the showpiece \"Into the Wild,\" a song that starts hushed but soon explodes. When she's in full flight on \"Into the Wild,\" LP can vocally resemble Neko Case, a comparison that is somewhat misleading; LP may share a taste for melodrama and powerful lungs like Case, but she's not an Americana artist, no matter how heavily she adheres to the tradition of auteur singer/songwriters. What makes LP and Forever for Now compelling is how she brings that distinctive individual stamp into commercial pop; she's part of a tradition but beholden to her times, not the past. As such, she draws upon anyone from Case and Rihanna to Lady Gaga and Patti Smith, turning Forever for Now into a bracing, distinctive debut that's also a statement of purpose. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "The surprise hit of the 1994 summer movie season traces the life of a half-wit through the major historical events of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, and this soundtrack album is a travelogue of the same period, from Elvis Presley's 1956 hit \"Hound Dog\" to Bob Seger's 1980 hit \"Against the Wind.\" Like the movie, the soundtrack to Forrest Gump succeeds at repackaging the familiar -- in the film, we revisit everything from desegregation and the Vietnam War to the self-centered trends of the '70s, and on the soundtrack, we hear the concurrent hits for the umpteenth time -- although, unlike the movie, the soundtrack doesn't trivialize what it recycles. Playing it is basically like listening to an oldies radio station, minus the commercials and annoying DJ patter, but just like many other song-oriented soundtracks, this is still a miscellaneous collection. That, however, didn't keep it from shooting into the Top Ten as the movie became a blockbuster. The double-CD version contains eight more tracks than the cassette. ~ William Ruhlmann",

        "summary": "Frontiers managed to give Journey four Top 40 hits, with \"After the Fall\" and \"Send Her My Love\" both reaching number 23, \"Faithfully\" at number 12, and \"Separate Ways\" peaking at number eight -- the same amount that 1981's Escape brandished. While they tried to use the same musical recipe as Escape, Frontiers comes up a little short, mainly because the keyboards seem to overtake both Schon's guitar playing and Steve Perry's strong singing. An overabundance of Jonathan Cain's synth work cloaks the quicker tunes and seeps into the ballads, slightly widening the strong partnership of Perry and Schon. \"Faithfully\" tried to match the powerful beauty of \"Open Arms,\" and while it's a gorgeous ballad, it just comes inches away from conjuring up the same soft magic. \"Separate Ways\" grabs attention right off the bat with stinging synthesizer and a catchy guitar riff, and \"Send Her My Love\" emphasizes Perry's keen ability to pour his heart out. The rest of the songs on the album lack the warmth that Journey is famous for, especially in their mix of fervor and intimacy shown on this album's predecessor. [The 2006 reissue of Frontiers added four bonus tracks: \"Only the Young\" from the Vision Quest soundtrack, \"Ask the Lonely\" from the Two of a Kind soundtrack, \"Only Solutions\" from the soundtrack to Tron, and \"Liberty,\" a rare song that first surfaced on the Time 3 box set.] ~ Mike DeGagne",

        "parentTitle": "Arcade Fire",
        "summary": "Fronted by the husband-and-wife team of Win Butler and RÃ©gine Chassagne, the Arcade Fire's emotional debut -- rendered even more poignant by the dedications to recently departed family members contained in its liner notes -- is brave, empowering, and dusted with something that many of the indie-rock genre's more contrived acts desperately lack: an element of real danger. Funeral' s mourners -- specifically Butler and Chassagne -- inhabit the same post-apocalyptic world as London Suede's Dog Man Star; they are broken, beaten, and ferociously romantic, reveling in the brutal beauty of their surroundings like a heathen Adam & Eve. \"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels),\" the first of four metaphorical forays into the geography of the soul, follows a pair of young lovers who meet in the middle of the town through tunnels that connect to their bedrooms. Over a soaring piano lead that's effectively doubled by distorted guitar, they reach a Lord of the Flies-tinged utopia where they can't even remember their names or the faces of their weeping parents. Butler sings like Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood used to play, like a lion-tamer whose whip grows shorter with each and every lash. He can barely contain himself, and when he lets loose it's both melodic and primal, like Berlin-era Bowie or British Sea Power. \"Neighborhood #2 (LaÃ¯ka)\" examines suicidal desperation through an angular Gang of Four prism; the hypnotic wash of strings and subtle meter changes of \"Neighborhood #4 (7 Kettles)\" winsomely capture the mundane doings of day-to-day existence; and \"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out),\" Funeral's victorious soul-thumping core, is a goose bump-inducing rallying cry centered around the notion that \"the power's out in the heart of man, take it from your heart and put it in your hand.\" The Arcade Fire are not bereft of whimsy. \"Crown of Love\" is like a wedding cake dropped in slow motion, utilizing a Johnny Mandel-style string section and a sweet, soda-pop stand chorus to provide solace to a jilted lover yearning for a way back into the fold, and \"Haiti\" relies on a sunny island melody to explore the complexities of Chassagne's mercurial homeland. However, it's the sheer power and scope of cuts like \"Wake Up\" -- featuring all 15 musicians singing in unison -- and the mesmerizing, early-Roxy Music pulse of \"Rebellion (Lies)\" that make Funeral the remarkable achievement that it is. These are songs that pump blood back into the heart as fast and furiously as it's draining from the sleeve on which it beats, and by the time Chassagne dissects her love of riding \"In the Backseat\" with the radio on, despite her desperate fear of driving, Funeral's singular thread is finally revealed; love does conquer all, especially love for the cathartic power of music. ~ James Christopher Monger",

Pop/rock behemoths of the 1970s and '80s, Queen is no stranger to the vinyl format, having released all but two of their LPs on the medium. Those two outings, Innuendo and Made in Heaven, appear here for the first time in their full form, spanning two LPs apiece. Rounding out this impressive box set is a lovingly detailed 108-page hardback book filled with the usual goodies (rare photos, snippets of handwritten lyrics, and other assorted bits of memorabilia). ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "Featuring the talents of guitarist/vocalists Jack Staffen and Eliza Callahan, New York duo Jack + Eliza are one part harmony vocal folk group and one part lo-fi indie rock band. Produced with subtle precision by Chris Zane (Passion Pit, St. Lucia, Penguin Prison), Jack + Eliza's debut album, 2015's Gentle Warnings, is a gorgeously minimalist yet somehow still lushly atmospheric album. Part of this dichotomy stems from Jack + Eliza's simple musical formula, which basically means they strum their electric guitars while singing thick resonant harmonies on some of the sweetest, most romantically dew-laden songs never to come out of the Brill Building in 1965. Although Jack + Eliza are literally just two people, and there are no pounding drums or gigantic band arrangements here, the impression Gentle Warnings leaves you with is definitely that of a rock band -- albeit one with warm sand in their toes and lovesick dreams on their minds. These are yearning songs delivered with a half-lidded, optimistic attitude. Smartly, Staffen, Callahan, and Zane do little to dress up Jack + Eliza's sound and instead focus on adding textures, like the subtle tambourine on \"Quarter Past the Hour\" and the fuzzy, perfectly timed guitar line that plays over \"Diamonds.\" And while you sometimes have to listen hard to make out the lyrics -- as they are often doused in tube-amp echo and the pucker of a slapback Fender Stratocaster -- what Jack + Eliza are saying often doesn't matter as much as the sun-soaked romantic vibe. That might sound like style over substance, but it's not. On the contrary, Jack + Eliza write utterly hummable, heart-tugging melodies, and cuts like the Teenage Fanclub-esque \"Oh No\" and the lilting \"Secrets\" are, as with most of the songs on Gentle Warnings, unforgettable tunes that you want to play again and again. ~ Matt Collar",

        "summary": "Around the time Coldplay's sixth album, Ghost Stories, was scheduled for release, lead singer Chris Martin announced he was divorcing his wife, the actress Gwyneth Paltrow. In light of this news, it's hard not to see Ghost Stories as a breakup record, a romantic confessional written in the wake of a painful separation. Certainly, the album bristles with references to broken hearts and regrets, ruminations on how the past informs the present, its every song infused with an inescapable melancholy, but the album doesn't play like a deep wallow in sorrow. It is soft, even alluring, a soundtrack to a seduction, not a separation. Much of that feel comes from the record's smooth crawl forward, how it's never hurried and always accentuating its good side, but there's also a sense that Martin, or the band in general, is anxious to a hit a reset button, to slowly recede from the artiness of the Eno-encouraged excursions of the late 2000s and reconnect with the sweet, simple band responsible for Parachutes. Like any attempt to revive the past, it's hard to reconcile that those were indeed different times. As majestic as they sounded in 2000, there was no denying Coldplay were a basic rock band, anchored on six strings and rarely finding textures outside of the confines of an amplifier. Fourteen years later, keyboards are at the group's foundation, a significant shift accentuated by their succumbing to a hallmark of modern production: they have a producer for every track. Coldplay may not be forceful, but within their incessant politeness they do have a distinctive personality, one that shines through whatever tricks individual producers bring to the table. Stars that they are, they can afford to enlist EDM sensation Avicii and R&B stalwart Timbaland to color individual tracks (they're responsible for \"A Sky Full of Stars\" and \"True Love,\" respectively), giving Ghost Stories a fleet electronic facility that undercuts Coldplay's reputation as a dogmatic rock band without ever suggesting the group is adventurous. It's a nifty trick, a record that skirts any accusation of stodginess yet still feels as comforting as a warm bath, which is why Ghost Stories never feels heartbroken. Often, it feels like the lament of the sensitive soul who just had his heart broken but won't let his pain detract him from picking up that pretty girl at the end of the bar. This may seem a contradiction but it also suits a band like Coldplay, who at this stage of their career quite clearly want to be everything to everybody. If your heart is shattered and you want to slide into self-pity, turn here. If you are feeling free and want to woo a new love, turn here. If you want to just enjoy every soft, supple turn a rock band could do, turn here. Coldplay are here for comfort, as Ghost Stories proves time and time again. [Ghost Stories was also released on LP.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Given the confidence and brazen ambition on Gist Is, the labyrinthine debut full-length from Adult Jazz, it's difficult to believe they're less than a year old as a band. University of Leeds music majors Harry Burgess, Tim Slater, and Steven Wells and York University engineering student Tom Howe recorded this set in a Scottish farmhouse. The band employs a wildly recombinant methodology in this sprawling meld of sophisticated indie pop, avant rock, folk, and yes, even a hint of jazz. Though this music does involve some electronic sculpting, it is painstakingly mapped out and played -- not sampled -- on an array of acoustic and electric instruments. There are dozens of musical references here and the listener can often readily pick them out -- the use of Lou Reed's \"Walk on the Wild Side\" in the jazzy offbeat soul of \"Be a Girl\" is an obvious example. But just as often, what initially sounds familiar is made wonderfully alien. The numerous musical inspirations are referents designed to draw the listener's attention toward this band's vast compositional palette. Opener \"Hum\" inauspiciously commences with a minimal keyboard drone and Burgess singing in a manner informed by plainchant for three full minutes. When the melody does open, an arresting distorted keyboard and bassline are guided by a swinging drum kit, horns, and toy piano to establish a lithe yet fleeting groove. \"Am Gone\" is introduced by near scatting vocals, but ticking cymbals, punchy keyboards, and bright guitar voicings create several simultaneous fragmentary melodies, and integrate the singer before a wind segment implies harmonic counterpoint. \"Springful\"'s fingerpopping meld of jazz and folktronica evolves toward pastoral psych pop with gospel implied in lyric and melody, even as backmasked instruments, wonky guitars, and a frenetic rolling bass drum refract its center. The nearly ten-minute \"Spook\" uses a droning piano and vanguard vocal techniques but mercurially extrapolates them to express myriad musical identities from modern classical vocal music (think Nico Muhly) to the 21st century equivalent of XTC-esque pop. The spacious production makes Burgess' gorgeous voice -- which moves from tenor to falsetto seamlessly -- a focal point, but given the sparse mix, it often acts as another instrument rather than a \"narrative\" centerpiece. Each track here twists, turns, and folds in and out of itself; what initially seems to be passionate, kinetic improvisation emerges as well conceived and executed song forms. And none of it is cloying; most of this album contains an emotional depth that anchors the sometimes dissonant and contrasting structural parts. Gist Is may not seem accessible on first listen, but any degree of patience will be rewarded abundantly. It's uncompromising yet masterful, an auspicious and perhaps even magical first offering. ~ Thom Jurek",

        "summary": "Though they remain well-known only to reggae fanatics, the Pioneers were, without doubt, one of the three or four most important and influential of the late rocksteady and early reggae vocal trios. Their two songs about the ill-fated racehorse Long Shot (titled \"Long Shot Bus' Me Bet\" and \"Long Shot Kick de Bucket\") are acknowledged classics of the genre, and \"Time Hard\" has been covered by just about every second and third wave ska band in existence. The Beat (known in the U.S. as the English Beat) ended their debut album with a fine version of the Pioneers' \"Jackpot.\" But the Pioneers really hit their stride with later material, much of which was quite poppy and soul-influenced. Their version of Jimmy Cliff's \"Let Your Yeah Be Yeah,\" which leads off this program, is one of the most thrilling reggae recordings ever committed to vinyl, and their rockish arrangement (complete with horns and strings) of Sam & Dave's \"You Don't Know Like I Know\" is almost as good. Their adaptations of \"Na Na Hey Hey (Kiss Him Goodbye)\" and \"Papa Was a Rolling Stone\" are less inspired, but still worth hearing. Give and Take is an excellent place to start your exploration of this band's catalog. ~ Rick Anderson",

Here, the duo crafts a poppier, new wave-inflected sound that recalls Tamborello's work with Figurine more than Dntel's lovely subtlety. However, Ben Gibbard's famously bittersweet vocals and sharp, sensitive lyrics imbue Give Up with more emotional heft than you might expect from a synth pop album. \"The District Sleeps Alone\" bears Gibbard's trademark songwriting, augmented by glitchy electronics and sliced-and-diced strings, while \"Such Great Heights\"' pretty pop could easily appear on a Death Cab for Cutie album, minus a synth or two. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "All the promise of his debut comes true on Aloe Blaccâs sophomore release, Good Things, a vintage sound meets modern problems release with a way too modest title. Right from the opening âI Need a Dollarâ -- which could be passed off as unreleased Bill Withers, no problem -- the album offers grand things, providing listeners with that solid, but not polarizing, style of social commentary Withers perfected. On the following cut, positivity is pushed (âSomething special happened today/I got green lights all the wayâ) in a manner thatâs far from sugary, but this singer who offers such warmth and humility on his smooth soul tracks is well aware of sin, and can get slinky in a Al Green style when warning against loose women on âHey Brother.â An even better example of this is his cover of the Velvet Undergroundâs âFemme Fatale,â which becomes much more than a clever choice, thanks to a convincing performance that suggests heâs been there. The organic production, real horns and all, is left up entirely to the Truth & Soul Productions crew (Jeff Dynamite and Leon Michels) but Blaccâs delivery is less traditional with phrasing and some slang left over from when he was a 24-7 rapper. Anyone with a taste for neo-soul should try Good Things unique flavor. It comes on familiar and comfortable and becomes more rich and rewarding with every return visit. ~ David Jeffries",

        "parentTitle": "Elton John",
        "summary": "It was designed to be a blockbuster and it was. Prior to Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Elton John had hits -- his second album, Elton John, went Top Ten in the U.S. and U.K., and he had smash singles in \"Crocodile Rock\" and \"Daniel\" -- but this 1973 album was a statement of purpose spilling over two LPs, which was all the better to showcase every element of John's spangled personality. Opening with the 11-minute melodramatic exercise \"Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding\" -- as prog as Elton ever got -- Goodbye Yellow Brick Road immediately embraces excess but also tunefulness, as John immediately switches over to \"Candle in the Wind\" and \"Bennie & the Jets,\" two songs that form the core of his canon and that go a long way toward explaining the overstuffed appeal of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. This was truly the debut of Elton John the entertainer, the pro who knows how to satisfy every segment of his audience, and this eagerness to please means the record is giddy but also overwhelming, a rush of too much muchness. Still, taken a side at a time, or even a song a time, it is a thing of wonder, serving up such perfectly sculpted pop songs as \"Grey Seal,\" full-bore rockers as \"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting\" and \"Your Sister Can't Twist (But She Can Rock & Roll),\" cinematic ballads like \"I've Seen That Movie Too,\" throwbacks to the dusty conceptual sweep of Tumbleweed Connection in the form of \"The Ballad of Danny Bailey (1909-34),\" and preposterous glam novelties like \"Jamaica Jerk-Off.\" This touched on everything John did before and suggested ways he'd move in the near future, and that sprawl is always messy but usually delightful, a testament to Elton's '70s power as a star and a musician.\r\nThe 40th Anniversary edition of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road expands the album to a whopping five discs. The first CD is devoted to the album itself, while the second combines nine covers by contemporary acts with B-sides, outtakes, and other stray tracks from the mid-'70s; the third and fourth discs showcase an excellent live show from 1973 at Hammersmith, leaving the DVD to present the 1973 documentary Elton John & Bernie Taupin Say Goodbye to Norma Jean and Other Things. The covers have nothing compelling but are usually pleasant, with the highlights being Band Perry's insistent read of \"Grey Seal,\" John Grant's contemplative \"Sweet Painted Lady,\" Imelda May's swinging \"Your Sister Can't Twist,\" Fall Out Boy's balls-out \"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting,\" and Zac Brown Band's \"Harmony,\" which keeps the song rooted in the '70s. The bonus tracks are a weird batch, containing some singles that popped up on the '90s Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player expansion and \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" a non-LP 1975 hit that has nothing to do with Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, but they're all good: \"Whenever You're Ready (We'll Go Steady Again)\" and \"Screw You (Young Man's Blues)\" are hard, humorous rockers and \"Step into Christmas\"/\"Ho! Ho! Ho! (Who'd Be a Turkey for Christmas)\" is one of the great '70s rock Christmas singles, with the flip being one of the rare songs from a superstar that sounds designed for Dr. Demento. The live show is energetic and deep, illustrating how strong John's catalog already was and how good he was in front of an audience. There's not a bad note of music here, and it's worthwhile for the superfans. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "parentTitle": "The Heligoats",
        "summary": "Over the years, Chris Otepka's work as the Heligoats has often seemed like a half-private affair, half-free-floating project courtesy of those who have collaborated with him live and in the studio. On Goodness Gracious, Otepka seems to have found one of the best balances yet between those two sides, a full-bodied affair that still suggests the low-key winter sessions that gave birth to the songs to start with. The band's almost flowing arrangements on songs like \"A Guide to the Outdoors\" and \"Rubber Stopper,\" the latter with a big post-punk-tinged guitar shimmer on the break, suggests a kindred spirit, if not an exact similarity with groups like the Helio Sequence. On quicker, more rushed songs such as \"Fish Sticks\" and \"Heat Vents\" there's a hint of the kind of communal punch so many other indie rock contemporaries especially love as well, but again not to the point where the band seems like they're just trying to borrow or slot into a particular group's approach. This all said, the Heligoats often sound more pleasant than truly remarkable, showcasing gentle accomplishments but not always putting a specific stamp on a sound, with nods verging at points on the overdone (the wind chimes on \"Aquifer\" could be a tip of the hat to the Beach Boys but just as easily suggest many other groups who have similarly used them over time). Otepka's most underrated talent may be a knack for good lines -- thus on \"Water Towers on Fire,\" \"like a phone I wish you were off the hook\" -- but overall, Goodness Gracious is a good album, but not quite a great one. ~ Ned Raggett",

        "parentTitle": "Tobias Jesso Jr.",
        "summary": "It's inevitable that Tobias Jesso, Jr. will be compared to '70s singer/songwriters with the unabashed, snark-free, open-hearted lyrics and piano-thumping tunes on his debut, the recent-breakup-inspired Goon. It conjures the era's mellow, synth-free AM pop and the essence of songs like Joe Cocker's \"You Are So Beautiful,\" Elton John's \"Your Song,\" Harry Nilsson's \"Without You,\" and Carole King's \"It's Too Late.\" A guitarist by experience, his piano skills aren't up to those of some of these pop legends, or the vocals either, for that matter, but that's part of what makes the record work in the way that it does: it's imperfect and feels impulsive. Album producer Chet \"JR\" White leaves in mistakes and human elements, which aids in the effect. If not for the presence of strings and double-tracking, opener \"Can't Stop Thinking About You\" (produced by Patrick Carney of the Black Keys and the Rentals) sounds as if Jesso sat down at his favorite aunt's piano and just started pouring his heart out. His uber-poignant \"Without You\" (not the Nilsson song) represents the album as a whole: there aren't more than a couple, mostly production-related surprises in the song -- the chords and verses and modest drum parts (played on this song by Haim's Danielle Haim) fall where anticipated -- it simply rips at the heart with its plainness, directness, and sincerity right from the opening, \"Why can't you just love me?/Should I move on or should I wait?\" Ariel Rechtshaid (Kylie Minogue, Usher, Vampire Weekend) produced the song and keeps it simple, sparse, and wistful. Not every song on the album is a breakup song, but they are all about relationships and matters of the heart. \"Hollywood\" is about shattered dreams, \"The Wait\" is about the search for someone new, and \"Just a Dream\" is a father's lullaby to his newborn after a dream about an impending apocalypse. The Randy Newman-evoking \"Crocodile Tears\" is uptempo and playful but still about perplexity and vulnerability. There's not much one can do to deny the emotional weight or the eerily '70s character of Goon; it's probably best to settle into the La-Z-Boy, flick feathered hair off of your polyester lapel, grab a box of tissues, and let it be. ~ Marcy Donelson",

        "summary": "Although recorded in late 2008, Gorilla Manor wasnât released until 14 months later, allowing Local Natives the chance to build a strong blog buzz before their debut hit American shores. The delay wasnât entirely beneficial, however, as Gorilla Manor sounds quite similar to a number of albums that flourished in the interim. Local Nativesâ sunny harmonies call to mind Fleet Foxesâ debut and Grizzly Bearâs Veckatimest, while the bandâs polyphonic hand percussion -- which, at its most frenzied, is almost tribal sounding -- evokes memories of Yeasayerâs All Hour Cymbals. For all its familiarity, though, Local Nativesâ first album is still an enjoyable piece of work, filled with enough pop melodies and multi-cultural quirks to make the year-long holdup fairly worthwhile. The band pitches itself somewhere between the post-punk camp and Afro-beat village, with the musicians often yelping their verses in multi-part harmony before barreling into Technicolor choruses. Matt Frazierâs percussion is sharp, crisp, and always in the foreground, often assuming as much importance as the vocals themselves, while the albumâs production -- courtesy of the bandmates themselves, along with fellow Silver Lake resident Raymond Richards -- stretches a layer of pan-ethnic atmosphere over all 12 tracks, a move that bridges any gaps in the young group's songwriting. Local Natives may have arrived several months late for their own party, but Gorilla Manor is a refreshing example of good quality trumping bad timing. ~ Andrew Leahey",

        "summary": "Like 2009's Manners, Passion Pit's sophomore outing is a fat thunderclap of soulful, echo-boom electro-pop that's as poisonous as it is precious, pounding out twinkling summer dance hymns that frame Michael Angelakos' elastic falsetto against a buttermilk sky thatâs secretly teeming with ominous storm clouds. With Gossamer, Angelakos' angst is pushed even further to the forefront, revealing an artist who doesn't just moonlight as a professional demon wrestler, but puts in a full day's work. Despite the flurry of pre-release woes (canceled shows, lengthy hospital stays, and the revelation of a botched, early suicide attempt, the latter of which is examined in great detail on the visceral and vulnerable closer \"Where We Belong\"), Gossamer is a triumph of youthful, bipolar tenacity that filters its manic energy through a cosmopolitan prism of pop avenues, from silky neo-soul (\"Constant Conversation\") to shimmery JÃ³nsi-inspired synth pop (\"Take a Walk\"), the latter of which takes a third-person approach, weaving a tale of a husband and father's desperation in trying to make sense of his own actions in the midst of a recession's relentless, bloodied backhand. Angelakos' pathos aside, musically, Gossamer bristles with the kind of accessible pop luminosity that's usually relegated to barren Top 40 nonsense, but Angelakos and company know what constitutes a proper earworm, and effortless, infectious cuts like \"I'll Be Alright,\" \"Carried Away,\" \"It's Not My Fault, I'm Happy,\" and the aforementioned \"Constant Conversation\" latch on to the cochlea like a xenomorph with a taste for Fun., Phoenix, and the Lightning Seeds. Though the environment that birthed the appropriately titled Gossamer may be a bummer, the end product is winningly majestic and brilliantly spun. ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "Like the majority of his oeuvre, Jim Brickman lays down an instantaneously successful combination that assures airplay on adult contemporary stations and feel-good new age programs for years to come. Like his works on his Ballads, Vol. 1 and holiday records, Brickman selects a few of his favorite traditional religious hymns and invites a few guest vocalists to perform on several compositions which helps to break up an otherwise instrumental-heavy record. Contributions from vocalists Ginny Owens, Mario Frangoulis, Selah and Chris Korblein all provide pleasant counterpoints to Brickman's airy piano arrangements. But it's the inclusion of soft rock staple Michael Bolton and his powerful performance on \"Hear Me (Tears Into Wine)\" that is the icing on the proverbial cake as far as vocal contributions go. While all of the vocalists add a pleasant touch to Grace's overall feel, Brickman's instrumental arrangements are the true stars of the show here, especially with his gorgeous revision of \"Ode to Joy\" (here called \"Joyful\") and the stirring \"Holy Holy Holy.\" It's not Brickman's finest album, but it most definitely is an enjoyable addition to his already impressive body of work. ~ Rob Theakston",

        "parentTitle": "Jeff Buckley",
        "summary": "Considering that Grace is the only actual album the late Jeff Buckley released during his lifetime, this Sony Legacy Edition, containing completely remastered versions of the original album, a 12-track bonus disc with bona-fide rarities, and a full-length DVD, proves a definitive and worthy addition to his catalog. Grace has been written about and discussed since its auspicious release in August 1994, and catapulted its creator to the forefront of popular music discourse. Since his death in 1997, the album has sold steadily and garnered an entirely new generation of fans. \r\nThis new edition, remastered by the estimable engineer George Marino, complements producer and engineer Andy Wallace's original mix. It's full of warmth, depth and dimension, without rounding any of the album's wooly edges. The bonus disc is another prize. It contains the long-rumored but never issued track \"Forget Her.\" This cut was tracked and finished for inclusion on Grace but was replaced by Buckley with \"So Real\" in the final sequence. There is also a previously unissued version of \"Dream Brother\" with different lyrics, as well as unreleased covers of Bob Dylan's \"Mama You've Been on My Mind,\" Screamin' Jay Hawkins' \"Alligator Wine,\" a blues medley that begins with \"Parchman Farm,\" and Nina Simone and Jesse Mae Robinson's \"The Other Woman.\" In addition, two cuts from the oft-bootlegged but never commercially released promo the Peyote Radio Theater EP: Alex Chilton's \"Kanga-Roo,\" and the Nag Champa remix of \"Dream Brother.\" The other wildly bootlegged but otherwise unreleased promo rarities here are a cover of the MC5's seminal \"Kick Out the Jams,\" the road version of \"Eternal Life,\" from the Columbia Radio Hour disc, and the out of print Buckley/Shudder to Think collaborative cut \"I Want Someone Badly,\" that appeared on the First Love, Last Rites soundtrack. What isn't here that was supposed to be is \"Strawberry Street,\" written about -- but not included in -- the press materials that accompanied an early advance of the set. It's a vintage 1988 song recorded with John McNally and bassist Tom Goodkind of the Washington Squares. Hopefully it will turn up on something in the future. The DVD features the four Grace videos of the tracks \"Grace,\" \"Last Goodbye,\" \"So Real,\" and \"Eternal Life.\" But there's more: There is a new video for \"Forget Her,\" with unseen footage, as well as an expanded version of the Making of Grace, with extra footage and interviews with bandmembers and Wallace that's still geeky in all the right ways. There's also a neat little discography chapter. The booklet contains notes on the cuts by Steve Berkowtiz, the reissue's producer, and a new essay by author Bill Flanagan. What it all adds up to is a fine, detailed package that gives fans a way to officially own superior versions of pirated items in much better quality and presentation, and a stunningly beautiful version of one of the 1990s most important and defining albums; one that has, and will, one suspects, endure well in to the 21st century, and have its own place in the classic rock & roll canon. ~ Thom Jurek",

        "summary": "\"I'm feeling restless; don't slow down!\" advises Matt Johnson during Grand, the hyperkinetic follow-up to Matt & Kim's equally hyperkinetic debut. Grand makes good use of that advice, sandwiching 11 songs into a half-hour blast of snare hits and bouncing, buzzing synthesizer riffs. Johnson handles the bulk of the vocals, singing every song in a nasal, nerd-chic tenor while overdubbing his own harmonies. Yet it's the chemistry between Johnson and his partner, drummer Kim Schifino, that helps fuel the band's energy, even if Schifino's presence is somewhat muted by the album's beefed-up production (which polishes her wild percussion into tight, precise beats -- not a poor decision, necessarily, but hardly representative of her live performances). Building off the template established by the band's first album, Grand aims for the middle point between sugared melody and punked-out swagger, making room for stomp-clap percussion, dancefloor electronics, and jingle-worthy songwriting along the way. Grand isn't quite as majestic as its name suggests, with only a handful of songs moving past the anxious minimalism that permeated the last album. For returning fans, though, it provides a familiar brand of punk music for happy people, for lovebirds, for those who wish Mates of State had more swagger and less glockenspiel. ~ Andrew Leahey",

        "summary": "Given that they've had releases on labels run by Josh Homme and Mike Patton, it's no secret that Mini Mansions have friends in high places. Still, the amount of star power surrounding the band's third album is notable: not only is The Great Pretenders on T-Bone Burnett's Electromagnetic imprint, it features collaborations with Brian Wilson and Arctic Monkeys' Alex Turner. However, the band is never overshadowed by these connections, largely because this is their strongest work yet. They spent two and a half years honing these songs, and more than ever, the album finds Mini Mansions living up to their name: The Great Pretenders is compact yet lavish, with melodies that sparkle like a chandelier and production that gleams like newly polished silverware. Songs like the breathy and breezy \"Death Is a Girl\" and \"Heart of Stone\" are quintessential Mini Mansions, with their airy keyboards and Beatles-meets-ELO vibe, while \"Honey, I'm Home\" recalls the kind of bouncy yet sinister pop that happens when Michael Shuman's other band Queens of the Stone Age gets near a piano. Yet Mini Mansions sound more modern and streamlined on The Great Pretenders than ever before, even when they break out the glitter on the glam flashbacks \"Fantasy\" and \"Creeps,\" where Shuman sings \"nothin's gonna get too deep.\" This deceptively blasÃ© vibe permeates the album's jaunty melodies and deadpan lyrics, suggesting that Mini Mansions are most genuine when they're wickedly ironic. This is particularly true of the tracks featuring guest stars: Wilson is a perfect fit as a backing vocalist on \"Any Emotions,\" adding a bittersweet tinge to its determined detachment. Meanwhile, Turner embodies the dark side of the band's cheery disdain on \"Vertigo,\" where The Great Pretenders' seedy undercurrent rises to the surface. Though they get heavier on the album's second half -- most successfully on \"Mirror Mountain\"'s gut-punching outbursts -- it's the way they bring their pop skills to the fore that makes The Great Pretenders solid evidence that Mini Mansions should be as well-known as the company they keep. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "The best Duran Duran compilation imaginable is a three-disc set containing the group's first two albums and a brief third disc summarizing the remainder of their career. However, EMI is so satisfied with Greatest -- a set that could use more room for the early years -- that the label has rolled it out a few times in various forms. It first came out 1998, in the shape of a 19-track CD, as soon as many Durannies forgot about 1997's Medazzaland. A video companion was released in some territories, but a fan's dream come true -- a two-disc DVD of the same title, with all sorts of bells and whistles -- came out in 2003. This particular version of Greatest, released in 2005, contains the original CD release, and a one-disc version of the DVD set is thrown in. The prime issue with the track listing is just as nagging as it was in 1998: too little room for other highlights off Duran Duran and Rio, since neglected singles and album cuts from those releases have aged just as well, if not much better, compared to the smashes. Fans of the hits from the self-titled 1993 \"Wedding Album\" will feel short-changed as well. Duran Duran, as much as any other group, just can't be served well by a single-disc best-of, so the compilers can't really be faulted, and the worthiness of only a couple inclusions can truly be debated. The DVD is a treat, though the absence of \"Planet Earth\" is nearly unforgivable. [The clean version of the release contains the censored version of the \"Girls on Film\" video. For some bizarre reason, \"Wild Boys\" is included in its 7\" edit form instead of the \"Long Arena Version\" seen on the unclean version.] ~ Andy Kellman",

        "summary": "James Taylor had scored eight Top 40 hits by the fall of 1976 when Warner Brothers marked the end of his contract with this compilation. One of those hits, the Top Ten gold single \"Mockingbird,\" a duet with his wife Carly Simon, was on Elektra Records, part of the Warner family of labels and presumably available, but it was left off. \"Long Ago and Far Away,\" a lesser hit (though it made the Top Ten on the easy listening charts), wasn't used either. In addition to the six hits -- \"Fire and Rain,\" \"Country Road,\" \"You've Got a Friend,\" \"Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight,\" \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You),\" and \"Shower the People\" -- that were included, the album featured a couple of less successful singles, \"Mexico\" and \"Walking Man,\" the album track \"Sweet Baby James,\" and three previously unreleased recordings -- a live version of \"Steamroller\" and newly recorded versions of \"Something in the Way She Moves\" and \"Carolina in My Mind,\" songs featured on Taylor's 1968 debut album, recorded for Apple/Capitol. The result was a reasonable collection for an artist who wasn't particularly well-defined by his singles. One got little sense of Taylor's evolution from the dour, confessional songs of his first two albums to the more conventional pop songs of his sixth and seventh ones. But one did hear isolated examples of Taylor's undeniable warmth and facility for folk/country-tinged pop. By the next summer, Taylor was back in the Top Ten on Columbia, and Greatest Hits was out of date. But it remains a good sampler of Taylor's more popular early work. [Greatest Hits was re-released on LP in 215.] ~ William Ruhlmann",

        "summary": "In many ways, 2005's Guero is designed as a classicist Beck album, a return to the sound and aesthetic of his 1996 masterwork, Odelay. He's re-teamed with the Dust Brothers, the producers responsible for the dense, sample-collage sound of Odelay, and the light, bright Guero stands in stark contrast to the lush melancholy of 2002's Sea Change while bearing kinship to the sound that brought him his greatest success in the mid-'90s. This has the trappings of a calculating maneuver, but the album never plays as crass. Instead, it sounds as if Beck is revisiting his older aesthetic and sensibility from a new perspective. It's a successful, mature variation on Odelay that proves his sensibility will continue to reap rewards in his second decade of recording. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Houston five-piece Buxton deepen their sojourn into experimental pop pastures on their expansive fourth LP, Half a Native. The group's journey began a decade prior when principal songwriter Sergio Trevino teamed up with multi-instrumentalist Jason Willis and bassist Chris Wise to record their folk-inspired debut, Red Follows Red, in 2005. With each subsequent release, Buxton expanded both musically and in terms of personnel, adding drummer Justin Terrell in 2009 and guitar/keyboard player Austin Sepulvado a year later. By the time they signed to esteemed indie New West Records to release 2012's Nothing Here Seems Strange, they had evolved from a fairly straightforward roots act into more adventurous indie pop purveyors with banjos who still bore some residual Texas twang. While their New West debut was a somewhat wiley affair that pitted Trevino's thoughtful songwriting against mildly chaotic noise bursts and sonic chatter, Half a Native is a far more understated set that leaves some welcome space between the gaps. Working with an outside producer for the first time, Buxton left their home state to record in Los Angeles with Thom Monahan (Devendra Banhart, Vetiver). Whether it's Monahan's influence, the change in location, or a bit of both, Half a Native has a gently melancholic, sun-warmed haze that filters throughout the album, helping it to hang together better than anything the band has released up to this point. The spacy, swirling guitars from their previous release are still present, but they now bounce neatly in a controlled environment softly coloring standouts like \"What I'd Do,\" \"Pool Hall,\" and the lovely title track. There's a weary romance to these songs that seem to want to escape down a ribbon of desert highway, and while this is a sound Buxton have sought before, it seems fully realized here on what may be their strongest effort to date. ~ Timothy Monger",

        "summary": "With a charismatic, dynamic, and theatrical lead singer who seems to channel the intensity of James Brown on-stage, a loose and punchy two-man horn section, and a garage band back line that holds everything down, Birmingham, Alabama's St. Paul & the Broken Bones at their best capture a retro-soul sound that echoes nothing so much as the classic Stax and Muscle Shoals sides from the late '60s and early '70s. Lead vocalist Paul Janeway's gospel-inflected soul singing is impassioned to say the least, and he wrings every ounce of sweat and soul out of the tracks included on this, the band's debut full-length album. From the opener, \"I'm Torn Up,\" the stage is set for track after track of slow-burning and heart-wrenching soul ballads, a form that is obviously Janeway's specialty. He croons, and roars, and gasps, and groans, and slides through these songs like the second coming of Al Green, somehow smooth and rough and raw all at the same time, pure emotion tempered with a dose of gospel spark, and there's no denying this is his show. The band's churchy, street-corner horn band sound is punchy enough to give Janeway all the heat and steam he needs, but also in-check enough not to crowd him, and songs like \"Call Me,\" \"Broken Bones & Pocket Change,\" the stomping \"Sugar Dyed,\" and the charming little soul waltz \"It's Midnight,\" which closes things out, really do sound like they come from another era when secular gospel was just becoming known as soul. It's a refreshing sound, even though it does nothing new. If there's a flaw to this fine debut album, it's that most of the songs are slow-moving, wrenching ballads, powerful if taken one by one, and Janeway wrings everything out of them, but they tend to fall into the same emotional groove. A couple more \"who cares, let's dance\"-type upbeat songs might have made this a smoother and more varied listen, but that's really a quibble, since voices like Janeway's only come around once in a great while. This debut album is pretty good, and this band shows a lot of heart. With a singer like Janeway, there's no reason to think that things won't just get bigger and better for this band. [Half the City was also released on LP.] ~ Steve Leggett",

        "summary": "Released swiftly after Ghost Stories -- just a year and a half, all things considered -- A Head Full of Dreams plays like a riposte to that haunted 2014 album. Where Chris Martin spent Ghost Stories in a mournful mood -- his sorrow perhaps derived from his divorce to Gwyneth Paltrow or perhaps not; it's best not to read too much into the tabloid headlines -- the Coldplay leader sees nothing but sunshine and stars on A Head Full of Dreams. Martin gives away the game with his song titles. He's quite literally having \"Fun\" on an \"Amazing Day,\" living for the weekend and viewing his impending middle age as nothing so much as the \"Adventure of a Lifetime.\" Coldplay match his optimism by tempering their signature soft focus, pushing themselves toward the light and undergirding the newfound positivity via glittering disco beats and a gossamer electronic sheen. Arriving after the deliberately dour Ghost Stories, this infusion of backbeat and glitz does indeed feel welcome and bold, suggesting the band is determined to seize every bit of life headed its way. This carpe diem spirit courses throughout A Head Full of Dreams, turning it into a 21st century equivalent of Steve Winwood's Back in the High Life, a divorce record where every end seems like a fresh new beginning. Appropriately, Coldplay invite more than a few guests to help usher them into this brave new world, the showiest being BeyoncÃ©, who overwhelms the band's innate politeness on \"Hymn for the Weekend,\" but Tove Lo eases right into \"Fun\" and Noel Gallagher amiably allows himself to be swallowed by the gentle wash of guitars and synths. All these cameos suit the overarching theme of A Head Full of Dreams -- how there's a big, bright, beautiful world just waiting to be discovered if you just open your heart and live a little -- and if this message is unabashedly corny, under the stewardship of Chris Martin, Coldplay feel genuine in their embrace of middle age. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "The second long-player from Christina Perri, the Los Angeles-based singer/songwriter responsible for penning the surprise 2010 hit \"Jar of Hearts,\" Head or Heart picks right up where 2011's rushed yet brimming-with-potential Lovestrong left off. More confident than her debut, yet retaining much of its vulnerability, Perri, along with a quartet of producers who include Martin Johnson, Jake Gosling, John Hill, and Butch Walker, explores familiar singer/songwriter themes with a keen pop ear, wrapping big, radio-ready choruses inside folksy verses, effectively bridging the gap between the laid-back folk-pop of a Jewel or Norah Jones and the slick, American Idol montage-ready showboating of a Katy Perry or Sara Bareilles. Case in point, the dreamy \"Human\" (the album's first single), a slow-building, heavy-hearted power ballad that imbues classic, coffeehouse-approved, confessional singer/songwriter tropes with an arm-waving chorus that's ripped straight out of the Kelly Clarkson playbook. To be more concise, Head or Heart works best when Perri leans harder to the pop side of the ship, as is the case on the soaring second single \"Burning Gold,\" a percussion-heavy, tastefully stylized, Florence + the Machine-inspired empowerment anthem, and the bouncy and heartfelt \"Be My Forever,\" the latter a duet with Ed Sheeran. The fact that almost all of these aforementioned songs are grouped together early on in the proceedings doesn't bode well for the album's back half, which is pleasant enough and consists of mostly piano-based odes to love both gained and lost. They lack much of the spark that propels the record's inaugural moments, but Perri has become such a pro at selling even the slightest of ideas that they never feel phoned in. ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "Following 2010's The Reluctant Graveyard (written from the perspective of the dead) and 2012's ambient, largely instrumental Paper Moon, Heart Murmurs is Minneapolis singer Jeremy Messersmith's foray back into the living world of big pop songwriting. The aptly titled LP shivers with the irregularities of its namesake, just as it beats with a steady, gushing pulse. Messersmith has long been a proponent of wistful and melancholic songs, but on Heart Murmurs he takes on the many romantic aspects of the heart, sung from perspectives of yearning, apathy, and regret, to name a few. Making his debut for Glassnote Records, he steps out from the D.I.Y. indie aesthetic of his earlier work to deliver an 11-track clinic on studiocraft that walks a fine line between big-budget pomp and careful elegance. Working again with Minneapolis producer Andy Thompson, the arrangements are streamlined and punchy, but with tightly woven strings, pianos, and other neatly sprung tricks. Beginning with the opening tale of unrequited love, \"It's Only Dancing,\" you're drawn into Messersmith's unapologetically human tales that he delivers in his warm, high tenor voice. Both in presentation and songwriting, Messersmith comes across as ultimately relatable in the same way that mentor and former producer Dan Wilson (Trip Shakespeare, Semisonic) does, but like Wilson, he strives for a higher artistic standard to transcend the often pedestrian adult contemporary genre where music like this tends to be placed. While some of the freewheeling creativity of his earlier records has been subdued, the grand scheme of Heart Murmurs is one of subtlety and artistic maturity. Songs like \"Bridges,\" \"Bubblin',\" and \"Hitman\" are wonderfully realized power pop ballads, and even if the single \"Ghost\" falls a bit too closely into the rousing strum 'n' kick Mumford/Lumineers mold, it is such a better-written piece of music than those bands' vacant hobo epics that it's not hard to get behind it. Taken as a whole, Heart Murmurs is a well-rounded and full-hearted record by an elite songwriter deserving of greater exposure. ~ Timothy Monger",

        "summary": "When filmmaker David Lynch backed a disquieting scene in Blue Velvet with Roy Orbison's \"In Dreams,\" he demonstrated the eerie atmosphere behind its pre-'60s innocence. Orbison disciple Chris Isaak played those qualities to the hilt in his shimmering, spare \"Wicked Game,\" so it was no surprise when Lynch included the ballad in Wild at Heart. What was surprising, given the fact that it sounded like nothing else on pop radio in 1990, was that \"Wicked Game\" became a breakout Top Ten hit, pushing Isaak's accompanying album Heart Shaped World to platinum status. Of course, there's more than that one moody masterpiece of a single to recommend Heart Shaped World. Isaak faithfully recreates his influences with production that's infinitely cleaner than Sun rock & roll, drawing more on its form than its attitude, but he's particularly suited to the sort of Orbison/Presley-style balladry that brought him a mass audience. His rich, sobbing croon is simply a gorgeous instrument, whether he's in a sonorous baritone or quavering falsetto. And he uses that instrument to tremendous effect here, coming across as a brooding romantic with a broken heart and swoon-inducing style. Of itself, Heart Shaped World is a pretty effective mood piece, showcasing Isaak doing a whole lot of what he does best. He does attempt a couple of rockers, but they never really rock -- much like Orbison, it's clear that ballads are his true forte, and given the spirit Isaak wants to channel, the numbers feel much too tame. But aside from that flaw, the rest of Heart Shaped World is a supremely elegant late-night soundtrack, equally suited to steamy romance or solitary heartache. ~ Steve Huey",

Comprised of America (1971), Homecoming (1972), Hat Trick (1973), Holiday (1974), Hearts (1975), Hideaway (1976), Harbor (1977), and America Live (1977), all of which were remastered in 2014, the collection is aimed squarely at completists. Like their closest sonic contemporaries Seals & Crofts, the trio of Gerry Beckley, Dewey Bunnell, and Dan Peek was an unstoppable FM/AM radio force for the era, securing future classic soft rock staples like \"Horse with No Name,\" \"Ventura Highway,' \"Muskrat Love,\" \"Tin Man,\" \"Lonely People,\" and \"Sister Golden Hair,\" many of which were impeccably produced by George Martin. Really the only thing missing here is the group's 1982 comeback hit \"You Can Do Magic,\" which would make Rhino's excellent 2000 Highway: 30 Years of America the better choice for casual fans, but longtime America devotees will appreciate having the new studio masters all in one place, as well as the neatly arranged original album art and inserts. ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "Guitarist, songwriter, and producer Blake Mills was celebrated as an outsider talent for his debut effort Break Mirrors in 2010. The fact was he'd already established himself among the fraternity of musicians. He initially recorded that set with the conscious goal of securing more session work. Mills realized it, and also did live work with everyone from Fiona Apple and Neil Diamond to Band of Horses and Norah Jones, and became a producer as well. Heigh Ho furthers the reach of Break Mirrors. Recorded mostly at Capitol's Ocean Way studio -- built specifically for Frank Sinatra -- its sound is warm, spacious, and full. He enlisted a cast of heavy friends to assist as well. Fiona Apple sings on two of the record's finest tracks. The first, \"Seven,\" is a heartbroken yet dreamy, country-ish love song (the other players include  Don Was, Jim Keltner, Gabriel Kahane, and Benmont Tench) appended by some contrasting (and tasty) funky blues guitar playing. The second, \"Don't Tell Our Friends About Me,\" is a shuffling, rockist Americana number. It's grittier yet lyrically more upbeat. The vibe is loose with twin tiples played by Mills and Jon Brion, and the songwriter's shambolic drums. The contrast in the singer's voices on the chorus -- Apple's tender alto and Mills' grainier baritone -- creates an emotional depth in one of the set's finest moments. \"Half Asleep\" is intimate and sweet; it's a nearly pastoral love song that feels like a lullaby with a 1930s-sounding coda. \"Three Days in Havana\" showcases a typically understated yet expert Latin tinge in the guitarist's playing, though the melody sounds like a nod to Elliott Smith. \"Before It Fell\" begins with an implied mariachi lilt. Mills uses both guitarron and guitar. Mike Elizondo's bassline is initially the only accompaniment. After the bridge, with Griffin Goldsmith's percussion and Rob Moose's strings simulating horns, it becomes a full mariachi boogie. There's a long, meandering trio jam entitled \"Shed Your Head\" with Keltner's drums and Moose's strings; it evolves from laid-back to a greasy cooker. It comes off as a labyrinthine intro to \"Curable Disease.\" Another broken love song, it's played as a duo with Keltner. It is so subtle in its melody and arrangement, it's evocative of another time -- say an early-'70s Ry Cooder album. This is another part of Heigh Ho's beauty. It moves through musical eras and genres without ever sounding out of place, too clever, or at all clumsy. Mills is as centered as a songwriter as he is a player and producer. There is nothing extra here and that's as it should be. Heigh Ho puts on offer much of what he's learned these past four years, and displays it all with acumen and openness. ~ Thom Jurek",

        "summary": "When Alex Ebert re-emerged in 2009 as messianic musical cult leader Edward Sharpe, many familiar with his previous band, Ima Robot, weren't buying it. With Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros, Ebert made the dramatic 180 from sleazy electroclash-leaning punk singer to grizzly bearded bandleader in an 11-piece down-home freak folk revue, bright psychedelic colors and farmhouse harmonies replacing his not too distant past of black leather and smirky sneers. Artists change constantly, and Ebert's reinvention wasn't completely laughable or phony. While mired with some cringe-inducing Jim Morrison aping and a generally cluttered sense of arrangement, the band's debut album, Up from Below, had some bright moments when the strength of the songwriting cut through the affectation and actually seemed genuine in a roundabout way. A few years later, Here is much the same. The bandmembers wear the whole communal free-living throwback hippie jamboree persona to the point where they dip into goofy character sketches and threaten to detract completely from some pretty catchy songs. The album opens strongly, with the undeniably catchy pair of tunes \"Man on Fire\" and \"That's What's Up,\" both rising to handclapping summits of old-fashioned Southern revival and jug band jubilation. The hooky choruses are solid, but there's a pretty heavy sense of musical theater throughout these highlights, leaving the Magnetic Zeros coming off more like Jesus Christ Superstar meets Emit Otter's Jug Band Christmas than the freak folk hoedown they were aiming for. Lead vocalist Jade Castrinos reprises her role trading verses with Ebert on these songs and later takes center stage on the electrified \"Fiya Wata.\" Castrinos' contributions feel spirited and from the gut, whether they're put on or not. Following a strong start, the album fades into a series of exercises in style or emulation. Washy group vocal slow-burner \"Mayla\" is an acid-soaked sunshine daydream of little substance complete with Jerry Garcia-styled guitar noodling throughout. \"One Love to Another\" is a striking exhibit of a Bob Marley ripoff, a daring move in even the most fried acid rock circles. While the string of affectations and re-creations of various sects of hippie culture aren't completely unenjoyable, they get old really fast, especially on the weaker material. Ebert's intentions and previous bands are really immaterial in the case of Here. The album comes up short in the song department and doesn't quite get by on its abundance of free-love signifiers. [Here was also released on LP.] ~ Fred Thomas",

        "summary": "It took Chris Storrow all of nine years to craft a full-length album as Bossanova, after several EPs and compilation tracks, but if anyone was afraid the results would be some sort of overcooked indie pop answer to Chinese Democracy, fear not -- Hey Sugar is fresh and spontaneous sounding stuff, with its synthesizer lines clean and gleaming and the beats infectiously propulsive whether they're emulating vintage disco or Merseybeat. While not everything on Hey Sugar is dance material -- the moody confessional of \"It Felt Like a Weight\" and the appropriately named \"Lullaby\" certainly don't qualify -- the lion's share of the disc gets its groove on in a pleasing variety of styles, from the sensuous sway of \"Blue Bossanova\" and the cool Euro-disco pulse of \"Rare Brazil\" to the glam rock accents of \"I'll Leave of My Heart\" and the keyboard-accented pop/rock of \"Calvary.\" Storrow and his varied collaborators manage to give this set a unified feel while allowing each song to have a personality of its own, and his knack for pop melodies of all stripes is commendable. As a lyricist, Storrow isn't quite as distinctive, and on some songs the vocals are pushed deep enough into the mix to suggest that he knows it, but this doesn't affect the craft of the music or the fact his gift with melodies confirms he should strive to make albums a lot more often. Not every musician has the maturity of vision on their first full album that Bossanova can claim on Hey Sugar, which suggests waiting until the time is right has definite advantages. ~ Mark Deming",

        "summary": "Between their strong comeback with Dear Miss Lonelyhearts, the promising side project French Style Furs, and Hold My Home, Cold War Kids had a creative rebirth in the mid-2010s. Recorded at their own studio, the band's fifth album is charged with an intimacy and intensity that began returning to their music with Lonelyhearts. Hold My Home is even more assertive than that album, with an opening trio of songs that rank among Cold War Kids' finest. They own their anthemic power on the brash \"All This Could Be Yours\" and \"First,\" even though the song's rousing stomps and claps are at odds with Nathan Willett's uncertainty. Willett and company play with this ambivalence even more expertly on \"Hot Coals,\" where he grapples with masculinity and emotions via pithy words (\"What ever happened to the strong, silent type?\") and punchy sounds, and later on the soulful tug-of-war between love and freedom \"Go Quietly.\" The rest of Hold My Home is nearly as strong, with Cold War Kids accomplishing many of the things they've strived for on their previous albums. \"Flower Drum Song\" is a reminder of just how powerful their music is when they hit the sweet spot between ambitious and overwrought, while the seductive keyboards and female backing vocals on \"Nights & Weekends\" put some slink in their stride. Overall, the band sounds even more natural than they did on Dear Miss Lonelyhearts, whether on the appealingly garagey title track or \"Hear My Baby Call,\" which incorporates soul and R&B influences effortlessly. This is some of Cold War Kids' best work since Robbers & Cowards, largely and somewhat paradoxically because they've shed a lot of their early theatricality (though song titles like \"Harold Bloom\" show they haven't lost their literary bent entirely). With Hold My Home, they emerge as a more [Hold My Home was also released on LP.] ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "A practical, no-frills clamshell box set celebrating the soft rock/folk-pop hitmakers' '70s heyday, the Warner Bros. Years 1971-1977 rounds up seven complete studio albums and one live LP. Comprised of America (1971), Homecoming (1972), Hat Trick (1973), Holiday (1974), Hearts (1975), Hideaway (1976), Harbor (1977), and America Live (1977), all of which were remastered in 2014, the collection is aimed squarely at completists. Like their closest sonic contemporaries Seals & Crofts, the trio of Gerry Beckley, Dewey Bunnell, and Dan Peek was an unstoppable FM/AM radio force for the era, securing future classic soft rock staples like \"Horse with No Name,\" \"Ventura Highway,' \"Muskrat Love,\" \"Tin Man,\" \"Lonely People,\" and \"Sister Golden Hair,\" many of which were impeccably produced by George Martin. Really the only thing missing here is the group's 1982 comeback hit \"You Can Do Magic,\" which would make Rhino's excellent 2000 Highway: 30 Years of America the better choice for casual fans, but longtime America devotees will appreciate having the new studio masters all in one place, as well as the neatly arranged original album art and inserts. ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "Holly Miranda could just as well copyright the words \"ethereal\" and \"atmospheric,\" given how effectively they describe her body of work, and that hasn't changed a bit with her self-titled third album. The songs on Holly Miranda are mostly built around pleasing pop melodies and are often catchy like nobody's business, especially \"Mark My Words,\" \"Whatever You Want,\" and \"Come On,\" but regardless of the mood or the tempo, which range from radio-ready to smart-girl-in-her-bedroom contemplative, Miranda fills her performances with a languid, laid-back feel that's as inviting as a comfy pillow. Even when Miranda is seducing the listener with the invitation \"We could f--k in the sun and dance 'til dawn\" on \"All I Want is to Be Your Girl\" (a beckoning few would want to turn down), she does so with a slightly stoned amiability that glides more than it gallops, a tone that's also audible on the considerably more downbeat \"Heavy Heart\" and the deeply private \"Hymnal.\" Miranda's various paths seem to invariably take her in a similar direction, but Holly Miranda shows that she's consistently strong at what she does, and Miranda and producer Florent Barbier have come up with a superb set of aural backdrops for these tunes, richly textured but well suited to the ebb and flow of the music, and in many respects more organic than what Dave Sitek came up with on 2010's The Magician's Private Library. Five years separated The Magician's Private Library and Holly Miranda, but her third album sounds spontaneous and well thought out at the same time, an exercise in folk-influenced indie pop that succeeds as both soul-baring and ear candy. ~ Mark Deming",

        "summary": "The problem with defining an era is, what are you going to do for an encore? It's a dilemma that has impaled many a worthy one-hit-wonder in the past, but few struggled more desperately against the inevitable than Thunderclap Newman, the group that could...nay, should...have defined the first half of the 1970s for anyone tired of the '60s supergroups, but who vanished instead into the box marked \"Whatever Happened To?\"\nThat, of course, is another essay entirely. But their immediate future -- that is, the weeks and months that followed the worldwide success of \"Something in the Air\" -- caught them creating one of the key albums of the age, a set that confirmed Speedy Keen among the finest British songwriters of his generation; that brought Pete Townshend production kudos that he never even tried to touch again; that bristled with at least half a dozen more surefire monster hits...and which sank like the proverbial stone. And still no one can tell you why.\nA re-recorded take on the hit opens the album; intriguingly, elements of the song's multitudinous hooks then appear and reappear throughout the remainder of the set -- a piano riff here, a bassline there. It brings a continuity to the album that puts one in mind of the similar tricks played by labelmates The Crazy World of Arthur Brown on their 1968 debut album, but they spread the joy over one side of the album only. Hollywood Dream bristles with hints and reminders, to bring the album an almost conceptual sheen, at the same time as the songs themselves race away in a dozen different directions. \nThree parts of \"Hollywood\" offer up a deliciously cynical examination of the movie scene, buoyed by an almost childishly lovely melody; \"Accidents,\" on the other hand, flips from a guilt-ridden catalog of childhood mishaps to a blindingly psychedelic instrumental passage -- at nine minutes, the album version is thrice as long as the maybe-familiar 45 rpm cut, and it's no exaggeration to say it's three times better, as well.\nFrom start to finish, then, Hollywood Dream is, indeed, a dream, an album for everyone and for all occasions. If you don't own it, you need to. And if you do, then why aren't you listening to it right now? ~ Dave Thompson",

        "summary": "Call Honeymoon the third installment in a trilogy if you will but there's no indication Lana Del Rey will put her doomed diva persona to rest after this album. Over the course of three albums, Lana Del Rey hasn't so much expanded her delicately sculpted persona as she has refined it, removing anything extraneous to her exquisite ennui. Honeymoon doesn't drift or float, it marks time, sometimes swelling with a suggestion of impending melodrama but often deflating to just an innervated pulse. Apart from the syncopated chorus on \"High on the Beach,\" any lingering element of the hip-hop affectations of Born to Die have been banished and so have the shade and light Dan Auerbach brought to Ultraviolence, a record that feels cinematic in comparison to Honeymoon. What's left behind is the essence of Lana Del Rey: iconic images of days of Los Angeles passed, all plasticized and stylized, functioning as lighthouses in stoned, sad daydreams. Mood reigns over all on Honeymoon -- melodies and tempos certainly aren't prioritized over feel; all the originals are purposefully languid, which is partially why the Nancy Sinatra sample on \"Terrence Loves You\" and \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,\" a cover allegedly in the vein of Nina Simone's original but bearing an organ out of the Animals, stick -- but underneath the dragging beats and austere arrangements, there's something approaching triumph. Where Lana Del Rey seemed weighted down by existential sorrow on her first two albums, Honeymoon seems comfortingly melancholic and that's the truest sign that it is the fullest execution of Lana Del Rey's grand plan yet. [Honeyman was also released in a \"fan pack.\"] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "The English music press can never let anyone be. They're always quick to hail the next big thing and, in this case, the next big Coldplay is Keane. Lowgold briefly held that title upon its debut release in 2001, but U.K. critics rushed to give that crown to someone else just because that's what they like to do. Keane didn't ask for it, but perhaps it's the overall majestic presentation of the band's debut album, Hopes and Fears, that does it. That and the fact that the Sussex trio doesn't rely on a formula of lilting melodies and feverish guitars to carry the weight of the album. Keane haven't positioned themselves to be kings of anything, let alone the next Coldplay. They sound nothing like Chris Martin and Co. Sure, Coldplay's biggest hit to date, \"Clocks,\" included only pianos, and they released the Safety EP on Fierce Panda, which is also Keane's label, but those are the only things Keane have in common with Coldplay. Alongside their beautiful, emotive dalliance of instrumentation is one thing that'll separate Keane from all the rest, and that's drive. The band's heartfelt ambition on Hopes and Fears is right there. It's impossible not to reach for it, really. Lead vocalist Tom Chaplin's rich vocals are as vibrant as any choir, and songs such as \"This Is the Last Time,\" \"Bend and Break,\" and \"Can't Stop Now\" reflect Keane's more savory, dramatic moments. Confidence bursts throughout, and for a band that has been around seven years and has never released a studio full-length album until now, achieving nearly epic-like status is quite impressive. Keane obviously have the songs and they have a strong voice leading the front; however, Tim Rice-Oxley (piano/keyboards/bass) and Richard Hughes (drums) allow Hopes and Fears to come alive with glamour and without the sheen of slick studio production. Even slow build-up tracks like \"Bedshaped\" and \"We Might as Well Be Strangers\" are just as passionate, if not more so, than some of the bigger numbers on the album. Some might find Keane's debut a bit stagy, or too theatrical at first, but that's okay. Listening to \"Somewhere Only We Know\" alone a few times is more than enough to convince you that Keane stand next to Coldplay, challenging them, and it's a respectable match at that.

        "summary": "Arriving in 2009, Hospice was the third album of graceful, often heartbreaking folk-flavored indie rock that Brooklyn songwriter Peter Silberman wielded under the Antlers moniker. The crushing, beautifully arranged concept album is delivered from the perspective of two central characters: an abusive bone cancer patient on her hospital death bed and a committed nurse who becomes attached and falls deeply in love, despite impending tragedy. Written over the course of two years by Silberman and then enhanced with additional tracks by Darby Cicci, Michael Lerner, Justin Stivers, and Sharon Van Etten, it's a woe-heavy record that could easily be crushed by its own weight, except for the fact that it's delivered with such ease. The narrative (completely written out in the liners) is gripping -- full of novelesque prose, reminiscent of Lou Reed's Berlin -- and the musical accompaniment complements Silberman's lyrics perfectly. Music box melodies are sung in a wobbly falsetto over acoustic guitar and piano, as tinges of Radiohead (Amnesiac era) electro production add accents, waiting until the perfect moment to swell up to monumental crescendos full of keyboards, accordions, harmonicas, harps, and trumpets. Arcade Fire are an overt touchstone, as are Neutral Milk Hotel and Cloud Cult, but Silberman's new composite proves itself a standout group among the many other lo-fi artists and chamber poppers, as well as a career-defining step up from the pleasant but nondescript feel of the two Antlers albums that came before this. As a songwriter, he has matured into an artist with a masterful sense of dynamics, and he ebbs and flows from one chorus to the next as he multi-tracks sparse sections into grandiose ones. In the same balancing act, Silberman tones down the album's deep personal sense of love and loss with occasional bits of dry humor. Morbid lines like \"Some patients can't be saved, but that burden's not on you\" are masked with uplifting music, and the morose moments are soon forgotten when the purposely less poignant line \"All the while I'll know we're fucked and not getting unfucked soon\" keeps the experience from becoming too much of a Hallmark tearjerker. Keep the tissue box handy, though -- the closer is a doozy. ~ Jason Lymangrover & Fred Thomas",

        "summary": "Hotel rarely shows, in any shape or form, traceable inspiration from the new wave and post-punk era Moby advertised as being in full effect. More surprising is that apart from the lovely ambient instrumentals that open and close it, the album is all valley and no peaks, suggesting that the shelving of his sampling device was the worst creative move he could've made. The first half contains simple -- as in basic and/or emaciated, so we're talking poor -- modern rock songs that tend to be anthemic and soul-searching in nature. Lead single \"Beautiful\" is one exception, a tongue-in-cheek thing Moby has imagined being sung by vacant celebrity couples. No matter how affable, vegan, liberal, bespectacled, or vertically challenged he is, the real irony is that a millionaire and former love interest of Natalie Portman has made a song of this kind (see also: Aerosmith's \"Eat the Rich\"). Beginning \"C'mon bay-beh, c'mon girl, c'mon bay-beh, c'mon girl, I love you bay-beigh, I love you now, I love you bay-beigh, I love you now,\" the heart of the song doesn't say much more, and some of the guitar jerks are a lot closer to Eddie Money's \"Shakin'\" than anything related to Joy Division. And, speaking of Joy Division, a very gentle version of New Order's \"Temptation\" is the album's deepest connection to post-punk; it's telling that Moby opted to leave the vocals to Laura Dawn, since he's less a singer than Bernard Sumner. This begins the non-rock portion of the program, which fans of Play and 18 might find easier to enjoy, but it's not much better than what precedes it. For instance, does anybody need to hear him volley obvious bedroom come-ons with Dawn, as he does on \"I Like It\"? (Because it's about as appealing as a phrase like \"Woody Allen nude scene.\") Hotel's saving grace is a bonus disc containing an hour's worth of ambient techno that's good enough for separate release. You could name the two discs after Moby's fellow bald artists, which would tell anyone what they need to know before proceeding. Disc one: \"Live's Ed Kowalczyk\"; disc two: Brian Eno. ~ Andy Kellman",

        "summary": "The much-anticipated third studio long-player from Florence Welch and her mechanically inclined companions, How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful arrives after a period of recalibration for the spirited English songtress. Arriving three-and-a-half years after 2011's well-received Ceremonials, the 11-track set, the first Florence + the Machine album to be produced by Markus Dravs (Arcade Fire, Coldplay), eschews some of the bombast and water- and death-fixated metaphors of Lungs and Ceremonials in favor of a more restrained sonic scope and an honest reckoning with the dark follies of your late twenties. This change is most notable on the workmanlike opener \"Ship to Wreck,\" a shimmering, open road-ready folk-rock rumination on the ambiguity/inevitability of post-fame self-destruction that, unlike prior first cuts like \"Dog Days Are Over\" and \"Only If for a Night,\" feels firmly rooted in the now. Whether it be simple maturity or Dravs' calculated production style, there's no denying that an effort has been made to dial back a bit on some of the pageantry of Welch's earlier works, and for the most part, her penchant for pairing mystic Bronte-esque pondering with similarly windswept pagan/gothic gospel rock is left bubbling beneath the surface. This attempt to reign in Welch's more histrionic tendencies yields mixed results, with some songs finding the sweet spot between bluster and nuance and others (most of them in the album's sleepy latter half) disappearing altogether. Of the former, the bluesy (and ballsy) \"What a Man,\" the propulsive and purposeful \"Delilah,\" and the gorgeous title track impress the most. Instead of building to a fevered crescendo, as is the Flo-Machine way, the latter cut, a transcendent, slow-burning, chamber pop gem, dissolves into a simple and elegant, yet still goose-bump-inducing round of horns, and is breathtaking without knocking the wind out of you. Whether How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful ends up being a transitional album remains to be seen, as there is enough of each side of Welch (the pastoral and the feral) represented to tip the scale either way. That said, her Brit-pop soul treacle is still miles better than some of her contemporaries' top-tier offerings, and when the album connects it moves right in and starts to redecorate, but when it falters, it's akin to a chatty party guest failing to realize that everyone else has gone home. [How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful was also released with two bonus tracks.] ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "Jagwar Ma's debut album, Howlin, takes the listener on a trip back through the alternative rock of the '90s, making stops along the way to delve into shoegaze, baggy dance jams, spaced-out psychedelic dream pop, bedroom electronic, and even the much maligned big beat sound. The genius move the duo makes is that when they come back from their trip they only brought back the good parts and none of the elements like \"Funky Drummer\" breakbeats or grunge guitars that would have dated the project. Instead, Howlin sounds both like a really, really good modern pop album and a brilliant update of the '90s which, had it been released in 1992, would have knocked some sense into groups like Happy Mondays and Chapterhouse. Back then, the chief architect of the group's sound, Jono Ma, would have been hailed as an innovator and borderline genius; vocalist Gabriel Winterfield would have been in demand as a collaborator for every dance music producer in the game; and the record's mixer, Ewan Pearson, would have been buried under a deluge of requests for his magic touch. In 2013, all those things should happen too, as all three combine to make something very special. Howlin is full of inventive sounds and super-hooky pop songs, with little moments of surprising beauty and breezy fun sprinkled throughout the record too. Whether bouncing happily on rubbery beats (\"That Loneliness\"), sinking into some murky funk (\"The Throw\"), hitting the dancefloor for a hip house workout (\"Four\"), doing their best to rehabilitate big beat clichÃ©s (\"Man I Need\"), or writing an almost painfully pretty electronic ballad to close out the record (\"Backwards Berlin\"), the group keeps listeners on their toes and in their happy place. The variety of styles the group tries on for size is surprising to be sure, but what's truly impressive is that they nail everything they try and, more importantly, give everything a consistent feel that makes every track sound like a Jagwar Ma track first and foremost. That's not easy for a band to do, but these guys make it sound like it was no big deal. They have enough musical skill, production smarts, and melodic grace to make you forget this is their first album. Howlin is good enough to make you forget most of the bands they were influenced by too, as it both embraces and somehow transcends the '90s in a flash of sound and vision. ~ Tim Sendra",

        "summary": "Given their string of amazingly choreographed and artfully executed music videos, it's sometimes easy to forget that OK Go's real talent is in making albums. Where so many other acts in their position might be content to rest on their laurels with a couple of catchy singles and the occasional viral video, OK Go have become a band in the habit of releasing old-fashioned, good-from-beginning-to-end albums, a feat that sometimes feels as though it's become something of a lost art. On Hungry Ghosts, the fourth album from the versatile pop outfit, OK Go continue to impress. Once again working with sonic visionary Dave Fridmann at his Tarbox Road Studios, the pop quartet delivers an album that's as satisfying texturally as it is melodically. This can really be felt on tracks like \"The Great Fire,\" where the band beautifully merges elegant pop melodies with Fridmann's knack for crunchy and spacious production, creating a sense of sprawling warmth that's hard not to love. A similar feeling runs through the veins of \"The Writing's on the Wall,\" a breezy and wistful pop gem that effortlessly surrounds the listener like a favorite blanket. Songs like these prove that while OK Go certainly have a charismatic presence, their music is able to stand alone without needing a treadmill dance routine or elaborate Rube Goldberg machine to distract the listener. All in all, Hungry Ghosts is another solid album from one of pop's most versatile and charming bands. ~ Gregory Heaney",

        "summary": "After the freakish hard rock of The Man Who Sold the World, David Bowie returned to singer/songwriter territory on Hunky Dory. Not only did the album boast more folky songs (\"Song for Bob Dylan,\" \"The Bewlay Brothers\"), but he again flirted with Anthony Newley-esque dancehall music (\"Kooks,\" \"Fill Your Heart\"), seemingly leaving heavy metal behind. As a result, Hunky Dory is a kaleidoscopic array of pop styles, tied together only by Bowie's sense of vision: a sweeping, cinematic mÃ©lange of high and low art, ambiguous sexuality, kitsch, and class. Mick Ronson's guitar is pushed to the back, leaving Rick Wakeman's cabaret piano to dominate the sound of the album. The subdued support accentuates the depth of Bowie's material, whether it's the revamped Tin Pan Alley of \"Changes,\" the Neil Young homage \"Quicksand,\" the soaring \"Life on Mars?,\" the rolling, vaguely homosexual anthem \"Oh! You Pretty Things,\" or the dark acoustic rocker \"Andy Warhol.\" On the surface, such a wide range of styles and sounds would make an album incoherent, but Bowie's improved songwriting and determined sense of style instead made Hunky Dory a touchstone for reinterpreting pop's traditions into fresh, postmodern pop music.

        "summary": "Anyone who dismissed a-ha as a one-hit wonder must have missed out on the band's fine debut, Hunting High and Low. Though the band spawned many further hits across the rest of the world, \"Take on Me\" exploded in the States and the group never cracked the top of the charts again. It's a shame, because the album contains a handful of songs that nearly match the manic energy and emotional crack of its big hit. Further, it's a cohesive album with smart pace changeups, and it rarely fails to delight or satisfy a listener's need for a synth pop fix. The opening kick is a huge one: \"Take on Me\" is a new wave classic laced with rushing keyboards, made emotionally resonant thanks to Morten Harket's touching vocal delicacy. It didn't hurt in the era of MTV that the song's video was a hyperkinetic blend of mind-warping animation and filmed footage with a romantic thriller's heart. Harket's hunky physique and cheekbones also didn't hurt the video's chances at heavy rotation. Getting past that video, \"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\" is just as thrilling. Starting as a sad ballad, it explodes into something much more, as chugging guitars and operatic synths keep pace with Harket's evocative vocal stylings. If ever a 1980s song qualified as Wall of Sound, \"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\" would be it. The remainder of the album sees a-ha switching deftly back and forth between dramatic overtures and classic new wave keyboard motifs. \"Train of Thought\" and \"Love Is Reason\" are reminiscent of early Depeche Mode or Camouflage, but Harket's rich voice and flair make them purely a-ha. The band explores decidedly European terrain in the theatrical \"Hunting High and Low\" and dances a pop waltz with the sweet \"Living a Boy's Adventure Tale,\" coming across like a marriage between the Blue Nile and Alphaville. Delightful song snippets \"The Blue Sky\" and \"And You Tell Me\" act as frosting on the cake or as glue between the theater and the dancefloor. One can't escape the feeling that Hunting High and Low is a product of the 1980s, but with highs like \"Take on Me\" and \"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.,\" and no lows in sight, a-ha's debut is a treat worth relishing. ~ Tim DiGravina",

        "summary": "Originally released in 2007 on the band's own Burly Time label and reissued the following year with two additional tracks, Hymns for a Dark Horse is that rarity, an album from the modern acid folk scene that doesn't sound like a hipster put-on by an act that five years before would have been trying to sound like the Strokes. Written when singer and guitarist Phil Moore and his girlfriend Beth Tacular were living in a remote rural cabin while Moore was working for the North Carolina Museum of Natural Science, tracking and cataloguing local birds, these songs are suffused with avian and other natural imagery, but in a very natural way that doesn't smack of the classic old rock band clichÃ© \"getting our heads together in the country, maaaaaaaaaaaan.\" Songs like \"Bur Oak\" and \"The Marbled Godwit\" have enough of the verbal mystery of vintage folk tunes to connect them to a larger musical continuum than the likes of Joanna Newsom can manage. Though the hipsterish oddness of the songs' arrangements -- alongside Moore's vocals and guitar, Tacular plays accordion and wallops on an old-fashioned marching band-style bass drum to keep time -- and Moore and Tacular's typically unlovely indie rock voices keep Hymns for a Dark Horse from sounding like a new generation Dock Boggs, Hymns for a Dark Horse stays close to the folk side of the acid folk label. [However, the two new songs on the Dead Oceans reissue, recorded after producer Mark Paulson joined the band as a full-time member, adding bass and drums to the duo's previously spartan sound, show that this vibe may now be a thing of the past. Though the dark, droning \"Matchstick Maker\" merely sounds like a slightly fuller and more menacing version of the rest of the album's signature sound, the full-band \"La Denigracion\" sounds straight out of Beirut's faux-European playbook.] ~ Stewart Mason",

        "parentTitle": "The 1975",
        "summary": "As well as having a mouthful of a title, the 1975's sophomore album, 2016's I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It, is the kind of ambitious, self-indulgent album that either marks a grand misstep by a fledgling band, or the start of something big. Produced by Mike Crossey, I Like It When You Sleep finds the 1975 picking up on many of the stylistic threads running through their Crossey-helmed, self-titled 2013 debut: synthy new wave, kinetic dance-rock, and atmospheric balladry. The difference this time around is Crossey, and the band's pristine studio execution, marked by a distinctive '80s adult contemporary aesthetic. While bands like MGMT and Vampire Weekend have long mined the VH-1 vaults for stylistic inspiration, there's nothing mannered about the 1975's retro-leanings. Despite their name and their ear for '80s synthesizers, the British outfit sound much more flamboyant than their contemporaries. This is primarily due to the contributions of lead singer Matthew Healy, whose overly wordy lyrics and weird, playfully dark persona -- sort of like a sexual Fraggle -- can sometimes put listeners off the pop scent. As he sings on \"The Sound,\" \"It's not about reciprocation, it's just all about me/A sycophantic, prophetic, Socratic, junkie wannabe.\" \r\nIn that sense, the 1975 are more in line with the swagger of artists like INXS, U2, or even Madonna for that matter, whose early hits clearly had an impact on the group's approach here. Cuts like \"UGH!,\" and the cheeky, plastic funk single \"Love Me,\" sound delightfully like something Madonna might have made in collaboration with Chic guitarist Nile Rodgers and art-pop duo Yello. Similarly, \"The Sound\" and the sparkling anthem \"She's American,\" feature brightly infectious hooks that wouldn't be out of place on a Prince album. In fact, there's a palpable R&B inclination running through much of I Like It When You Sleep. It's a vibe that reaches an apex on the yearning, mid-album slow-jam, \"If I Believe You,\" which also happens to feature a gorgeously rendered flÃ¼gelhorn solo from jazz star and longtime D'Angelo collaborator Roy Hargrove. \r\nElsewhere, in keeping with the overall '80s adult contemporary sound, tracks like the shimmeringly moody \"Somebody Else\" and the sweetly romantic \"Paris,\" bring to mind Tango in the Night-era Fleetwood Mac. Admittedly, at 17 tracks, I Like It When You Sleep is long. And given the poetic, atmospheric nature of many of the songs, it's somewhat unwieldy in one sitting. Ultimately, however, it's that uncompromising mix of POP (in capitalize letters) and inventive, exploratory musicianship that help make it such a rewarding listen. As the title implies, it may take the 1975 a while to get to the point on I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It, but when they do, the results are revelatory. ~ Matt Collar",

This was enough to sustain a vigorous cult audience well into 2014, which is when Legacy boxed all ten of the Alan Parsons Project albums, adding the scrapped 1981 record The Sicilian Defense to bring in the hardcore who already have purchased this catalog several times over, including deluxe editions that contain bonus material nowhere to be found here. Aside from The Sicilian Defense, a tedious exercise in art rock designed to get APP out of their contract with Arista (it's hard not to see why the label asked them to go back in the studio; The Sicilian Defense is all formless instrumentals, lacking the drama of 1980's The Turn of a Friendly Card or the crossover soft rock of 1982's Eye in the Sky), extras aren't the reason to get this set. This is, like so many similar box sets in the 2010s, a tidy and affordable to get a good-sounding, good-looking complete discography from a notable album rock artist, so if you happen to be in the market for a deep dive into the Alan Parsons Project, this is the way to go. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "After experiencing a worldwide hit with the title track of their 2009 album, Walking on a Dream, Empire of the Sun did the sensible thing and made a follow-up album that capitalizes on the glossy, sunny pop of that song. Instead of exploring some of the more esoteric avenues they started down on their debut, on Ice on the Dune the duo of Nick Littlemore and Luke Steele focus with laser-sharp intensity on creating an album that is 110 percent POP with no sharp edges and all glittering sunshine, blown out to gigantic proportions. In less skilled hands, such a tactic could lead to an over-produced trinket that's good for maybe half a listen and then gets tossed aside. Instead, Ice on the Dune ends up being everything a good modern pop record should be, and then some. The songs have super-sharp choruses, incessantly listenable arrangements built on acoustic, electric, and programmed instruments, and icy-cold but immediate beats, sometimes sounding like Katy Perry produced by Jeff Lynne, sometimes sounding like ELO produced by Katy Perry. Everything feels like a radio hit; everything feels custom made for listeners who like the sound of modern pop but are put off by the surfacy distractions that come along with it. Here you only have to deal with crazy headgear (check the cover) and the OTT ballad that ends the album in an overwrought splash of powdery tears. Otherwise, it's all perfectly crafted songs that draw on disco influences (\"Old Flavours\"), soft rock (\"Ice on the Dune\"), throbbing Madonna-inspired club jams (\"Celebrate\"), and Daft Punk (\"Awakening\"), along with a couple that give \"Walking on a Dream\" a fair run in the catchiness stakes (\"Alive\" and the incredibly bouncy and fun \"Surround Sound\"). Too many times having a big hit can send a group off the rails as it pursues the spotlight and tries to catch lightning again. The guys in Empire of the Sun manage to not only catch the lightning again, but their skill at crafting perfect pop, the depth in their songs, and the emotion their voices transmit make this record better than one might have ever expected. Modern pop doesn't get any better than this. [Ice on the Dune was also released on LP.]  ~ Tim Sendra",

        "summary": "Toronto-based jazz trio BadBadNotGood's third album is their first on the Innovative Leisure label and also the first full-length to feature all their own compositions. The Canadians first made waves early in the 2010s while posting videos of them playing jazz covers of hip-hop tracks by the likes of Odd Future and MF Doom. They maintained this ethos into their first two records, BBNG and BBNG2, by covering the likes of A Tribe Called Quest and Kanye West as well as My Bloody Valentine and Feist. III captures the raw energy, togetherness, and musicianship of a live concert, at points drifting off at a tangent and then rejoining to climactic chord structures and beautiful jazz melodies. One thing that is very clear is that Matthew Tavares (keyboards, synths), Chester Hansen (bass), and Alexander Sowinski (drums) are all fantastic musicians and rightly sought-after, being cherry-picked by the likes of Frank Ocean to be his backing band. The groove here is tight and so many intricate details unravel over the nine tracks, fluidly drifting in among each other with some wonderful solo jazz freakouts, while each member takes his turn. The album kicks off with \"Triangle,\" perhaps the most traditionally jazz-sounding number on the album, flowing into \"Can't Leave the Night,\" which is different but still creates a coherent opening to the album and is a precursor of how things will pan out, gelling genres such as hip-hop, jazz, and electronica effortlessly. \"Can't Leave the Night\" has the feel of a mid-'90s dance groove from DJ Shadow's Endtroducing... era before a sub-friendly climactic ending built up of arpeggiated synths and straight drum rhythms. Saxophonist and frequent collaborator Leland Whitty features on the track \"Confessions,\" which is a smoky jazz number a little bit reminiscent of the early Bonobo records. \"Kaleidoscope\" is possibly the best track on the record, especially the latter part for its bass freakout and the way in which the group twists toward the blissful, beautiful jazz brass section and whistle-inducing melody line. \"Since You Asked Kindly\" could be the strangest inclusion here, as it's almost a different style altogether. As a whole, this is a great inclusion to an already impressive catalog and it's good to see a full-length of their own material. [III was also released on LP.] ~ James Pearce",

        "summary": "if you donât count his dozens of cassette releases, Ducktails III: Arcade Dynamics is Matthew Mondanile's third proper album, but the mention of \"arcade\" in the album title might be deceiving. Instead of continuing in the synthesized chillwave tradition of Landscapes, for this release the Real Estate guitarist takes a step back from electronics, and records conventional two- or three-chord lo-fi pop songs to 8-track with organic instruments. Guitars are in the foreground, along with a traditional bass and drum setup. This is a pretty radical departure for Ducktails. Dimestore keyboards and Casio beats are left by the wayside to make the music comparable to that of Kurt Vile or a Calvin Johnson side project (take your pick, add delay and flanger pedals, and you have the idea). There were hints of this direction on prior albums, and now, the song structures have been consolidated into tight little numbers played in a washed-out basement vibe, complete with slap-back vocals. Characteristically, Mondanile's outings have a sketchpad feel to them, and there are quite a few half-finished ideas onboard, including a dreamy ten-minute outro of simple fingerpicking to the echoes of faraway fireworks. However, a few standouts bring Arcade Dynamics to life, namely the sweet, Seinfeld-referencing âArt Vandelayâ and âKillin the Vibe,â which finds the likely cohort Panda Bear providing a backbeat and warm vocal harmonies. ~ Jason Lymangrover",

        "summary": "With two states down and only 48 to go, Sufjan Stevens' ambitious musical map of the Unites States of America should be completed -- if he puts out one a year -- sometime around 2053. It's a daunting task (and not an entirely original one at that), but if each subsequent record is as good as Illinois, fans who live long enough to witness the project's completion will no doubt find themselves to be scholars of both state history and its narrator's shape-shifting soul. Stevens' folk epics, as played by his signature mini-orchestra, have changed little since his 2003 foray into Michigan -- a charge that may cause some grumbling among that album's detractors -- but there's a newfound optimism that runs through much of Illinois that echoes the state's \"Gateway to the West\" pioneering spirit. Glorious road trip-ready cuts like \"The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts,\" \"Come On! Feel the Illinoise!,\" and \"Chicago\" have an expansiveness that radiates with the ballast of history and the promise of new beginnings. Stevens has done his research, with references to everyone from Abe Lincoln, Frank Lloyd Wright, and the ghost of Carl Sandburg to John Wayne Gacy -- the latter provides one the song cycle's most affecting moments. The lush (yet still distinctly lo-fi) indie pop melodies draw as much from classic rock as they do progressive folk. \"Jacksonville,\" with its four-chord banjo lurch, mines \"Old Man\"-era Neil Young, disco strings dance around \"They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!! They Have Come Back from the Dead!! Ahhhh!,\" while the rousing pre-finale \"The Tallest Man, the Broadest Shoulders\" is pure Peanuts-infused Vince Guaraldi as filtered through the ambiguous kaleidoscope of Danielson Famile spiritualism. There's a distinct community theater vibe to the whole affair that may or may not be the result of numerous photo shoots in which the players are dressed in adult-style Boy Scout uniforms -- it brings to mind the Blaine Players from Christopher Guest's small-town theater parody Waiting for Guffman -- but the majority of Illinois is alarmingly earnest. Stevens may be a snake-oil salesman, but he's got pretty good stuff, and like many of history's most untrustworthy wordsmiths, he somehow manages to switch the opportunist off and turn on the human being each time the listener gets suspicious of his intentions. ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "Some roots rock performers go far out of their way to convince you of their down-home bona fides, but Rayland Baxter's music sounds as easily and unaffectedly Southern as a glass of sweet iced tea enjoyed on the back porch on a warm and slightly humid day. There's not a lot of twang in Baxter's music (or his voice), but his melodies and arrangements are evocative in the manner of a good novel, painting a vivid portrait of time and place, and there's a laid-back but emotionally powerful vibe to his lyrics and vocals that's smart but unpretentious, and generates a sense of drama that feels low key on the surface, but inside is as potent as vintage Tennessee Williams. Rayland Baxter's second album, 2015's Imaginary Man, shows he's not afraid of being a grand-scale romantic, portraying himself as a regretful heartbreaker on \"Yellow Eyes,\" painting regret in several different colors in \"Mother Mother,\" and opening up his heart on \"Rugged Lovers\" and \"All in My Head.\" Baxter's songs are supported by concise but colorful arrangements (with thoughtful string charts and occasional pedal steel work from Rayland's father, Bucky Baxter) that make clever use of echo and reverb to give the performances a rich, powerful sound that makes their case without weighing down the music. And if Baxter isn't quite the virtuoso as he is a singer, he knows instinctively how to tell his stories and make his characters seem real and compelling. Imaginary Man presents Baxter and his material in a manner that's vividly passionate and a little swampy while avoiding cliches as he offers these sketches on life and love in the American South; it's a big step forward for Baxter, and will hopefully help him gain the audience he deserves.

        "summary": "With an album behind him, Weird Al Yankovic makes much of the improvements expected of new artists when they get a second crack at a release a year later. He premieres the concept of his own band, basically well-trimmed types that looked good in music videos. They also play very well as a unit, so whatever image augmentation was accomplished is just a side benefit. While Yankovic's first album started off poorly and took awhile to build momentum, this one is like a garage door opening to reveal a shiny rocketship about to blast off. When it does, it is \"Eat It,\" a satire of Michael Jackson's \"Beat It\" that can be considered the first kick in the rear the mighty gloved one received on his way down from the throne of pop music. Making the song a tribute to stuffing one's face with food takes away its phony edge of nastiness without removing any of its rhythmic power. In fact, this version rocks harder than the original, and Rick Derringer's solo in the middle cuts Eddie Van Halen to shreds. From there, it would seem the man is on a roll, but listeners may wind up stifling yawns all the way to the side-ending \"Polkas on 45,\" Yankovic's first attempt at what evolved into a repeated device on subsequent albums, the extended, snappy polka medley in which an incredible variety of pop hits appear, sometimes for only a line or two. The fine musicianship of the leader and his associates is revealed in these performances, which tend to be some of Yankovic's best work. Playing medleys such as this is not easy, and doing it with such energy and wit is even more admirable. The original songs on this record are just as forgettable as any Yankovic had come up with so far. There is no chance of pleasing 11 year olds with any of the originals, despite the fact that many critics feel this is the level of mind Yankovic is aiming at when he gets in the songwriting mode. It is not that their age estimate is too high, either. No children of any age have expressed much interest in the original material here. The thematic thrust of In 3-D comes full circle with the hilarious \"Theme From Rocky XIII,\" often known as \"The Rye or the Kaiser.\" Once again the height of pomposity -- in this case, the character created by Sylvester Stallone -- gets knocked down to knee size by setting the action in a deli, round two probably consisting of a jar of pickles being opened. When this album is good, it is good enough to eat, so \"Eat It\" already. ~ Eugene Chadbourne",

        "summary": "The full-length debut album from Los Angeles' Capital Cities, 2013's In a Tidal Wave of Mystery is an infectious mix of synth-heavy dance pop. These musically ambitious productions touch upon '80s new wave and '70s disco in the bandâs own unique, lo-fi way. In fact, part of the albumâs charm is that many of the songs here sound like keyboard-heavy demos that were perhaps meant to be fleshed out with various instruments but never were. Hence, the preponderance of synth trumpet, digital strings, and other extremely old-school-sounding electronic samples. The result is that the album brings to mind the early, innovative electronic music of artists who were earnestly taken with the explicitly computer-generated sounds of the modern wonder that was the synthesizer, like Level 42 and Giorgio Moroder. In that sense, In a Tidal Wave of Mystery fits in nicely alongside the works of such similarly inclined indie pop contemporaries as AM & Shawn Lee, MGMT, Phoenix, and the Strokes' Julian Casablancas' solo work. Featured on the album is the Top Ten radio hit \"Safe and Sound.\" [A Deluxe Edition with four bonus tracks was also released.] ~ Matt Collar",

        "summary": "Compared to Jamie xx's impact on music, it's easy to forget that he hasn't released much on his own. The distinctive yet surprisingly versatile blend of indie, R&B, and dance in his work with the xx, Gil Scott-Heron, and his remixes helped shape the sound of the late 2000s and 2010s, but his solo discography was limited to a handful of singles, many of which appear on his first full-length, In Colour. While one of his best singles, \"All Under One Roof Raving,\" doesn't appear on the album, its balance of the kinetic and the atmospheric -- as well as its reverence for classic U.K. dance music -- is reflected on some of In Colour's brightest highlights. \"Gosh\" is hard-edged yet radiant, its juddering drum'n'bass rhythms and shouted samples adding heft and movement before swelling synths overtake the track like a sunrise after a long night out. Indeed, for most of the album, Jamie xx uses his considerable gifts for atmosphere to make listeners remember the euphoria of dance music rather than immerse them in it. Despite its brassy flourishes, \"Girl\"'s filtered house is haunting and aloof instead of driving, while its former B-side \"Sleep Sound\" fades in and out like a dream. Given his skills as a collaborator, it's not surprising that some of In Colour's best moments occur when he shares the spotlight. While his reunion with xx bandmate Oliver Sim on the implosive \"Stranger in a Room\" is almost too reminiscent of their previous work, Romy Madley Croft remains one of his most inspiring muses. She gives In Colour's nostalgia more humanity on the beautifully blurred \"Seesaw\" and \"Loud Places,\" where a sample of Idris Muhammad's joyous \"Could Heaven Ever Be Like This\" makes the contrast between then and now, and alone and together, all the more poignant. However, the album's most immediate moment belongs to Young Thug and Popcaan. Inspired by a drive from Manhattan to Brooklyn while listening to Hot 97, the summery \"I Know There's Gonna Be (Good Times)\" embraces pop, hip-hop, and dancehall in a way that feels evocative and forward-looking. As it moves from reflective to engaging and back again, In Colour covers the entire spectrum of Jamie xx's music, delivering flashes of brilliance along the way.

        "parentTitle": "Cut Copy",
        "summary": "In Ghost Colours announces itself, calmly but majestically, with a wash of hazy voices and fluttering keyboards giving way to crystal-clear acoustic strums, languid indie pop vocals, a sturdy dance-rock groove, pulsating electro-disco synths, swirling Caribou-style psychedelics, and an ethereal, vocoded chorus melody. Squeezing all of that into one song -- the effervescent \"Feel the Love\" -- is an ambitious move: in most hands it would come out sounding like a bewildering mess, or at least a hammy, hyperactive pastiche, but Cut Copy manage to keep it light, breezy, and utterly ebullient. Even more impressive is that they're able to replicate the trick repeatedly across this remarkably assured sophomore album. Colours boasts at least a half-dozen potential summer anthems for dancefloors and headphones alike, seamlessly strung together with subdued interstitial mood pieces that help make it more of a nuanced work than a straightforward collection of relentlessly upbeat dance jams. Undeniably, though, the dance jams are at the throbbing heart of the album, from the unstoppably glittery opening trio (leading up to the anthemic slow-burn disco of single \"Lights and Music\") to the rough-edged rock drive of \"So Haunted\" to the pure synth pop bliss of \"Far Away.\" Indeed, this is in many ways a perfect summation of the dynamic, multifaceted, hipster-associated independent dance music of the 2000s, a motley interweaving of pop, rock, and electronic dance elements into a kaleidoscopic array of interconnected styles, some strands of which have been summarily, imprecisely tagged (\"disco-punk,\" \"electro-house,\" \"new rave,\") but which as a whole remain resolutely, gloriously nebulous and undefined. (Though nevertheless undeniably prevalent, and never more so than in 2008, following triumphant runs by LCD Soundsystem, Justice, and Simian Mobile Disco; the months just preceding In Ghost Colours' release saw eminently enjoyable new albums by Hot Chip, Hercules and Love Affair, Neon Neon, and Does It Offend You, Yeah?, to name a few.)\r\nCut Copy's music bears all the prominent hallmarks of its era: giddily omnivorous stylistic appropriation, a sensuous, sybaritic (though not, in their case, seedy) demeanor, and the distinct evocation of bygone decades, most palpably the ubiquitous post-punk/post-disco '80s, without succumbing to the pitfalls of overzealous eclecticism, empty hedonism, sugary glut, and blatant derivativeness. Or rather, they do show traces of all of these things, but they play each one off as a strength, always in moderation, and never to the detriment of the music. The eclecticism is there but it's fluid and cohesive rather than distractingly showy; their influence-dogging plays like affectionate homage rather than pointless mimicry; there's an abundance of gleaming, even gaudy surfaces, but they're just too rapturously enticing to entertain qualms about superficiality. It surely helps that they have one of the primary architects of this sprawling scene, the DFA's Tim Goldsworthy, on board as a producer and mixer. More importantly though, beneath its perfectly formed surfaces this is truly an album of songs -- a surprisingly rare thing in this milieu -- with simple but resonant melodies, carried by Dan Whitford's appealingly casual delivery, which help alleviate a slight tendency toward sonic sameness. This is evident not only on the gentler guitar-based numbers, like the loping \"Unforgettable Season\" and the oddly country-inflected \"Strangers in the Wind,\" which temporarily scale back the dancefloor euphorics, but the out-and-out burners as well, combining with the peppy basslines and nagging chorus hooks to create something all the more transcendent. To be sure, In Ghost Colours is a triumph of craftsmanship rather than vision -- a synthesis and refinement of existing sounds rather than anything dramatically new and original -- but it is an unalloyed triumph nonetheless, and one of the finest albums of its kind.

        "summary": "JosÃ© GonzÃ¡lez earned himself a lot of fans with his first album, Veneer. Songs from it were placed in TV shows and featured in ads, he appeared on Top of the Pops and played festivals, and became a sought-after guest vocalist for electronic artists (Zero 7, Savath & Savalas, Plan B). His intimate, tender sound featuring just his voice and a skillfully played acoustic guitar struck a chord all around the world. The long lag between the recording of Veneer (which was originally released in Sweden during 2003 and only widely available in 2005) and the release of the follow-up, 2007's In Our Nature, might lead fans to think that time might bring about a change in GonzÃ¡lez's sound. Those fears prove to be groundless. Despite teasing some changes with a fuller, more arranged sound featuring a backing band on the 2006 EP Stay in the Shade, In Our Nature is a near sonic clone of Veneer, right down to the cover of a classic electronica track (this time it's Massive Attack's \"Teardrops\"). This is great news for people looking for more of the same quiet, stark, but beautiful songs and performances, but if you were looking for some kind of change or progression, you're out of luck unless you listen quite intently and get past the smooth surface. What you'll find are more political lyrics (like on the opening \"How Low,\" which shoots verbal daggers at war-mongering world leaders), more passionate vocals, some more forceful guitar playing, and a general sense of urgency and unease bubbling underneath the prettiness. It may take a few listens before the record reveals itself as a relative cauldron of restrained emotion, but it's worth the effort. Or you could choose to let the moody songs and melancholy atmosphere relax and sooth you. Either way the record is sure to please the fans who latched on to Veneer. ~ Tim Sendra",

        "summary": "Perhaps best likened to a marching band on an acid trip, Neutral Milk Hotel's second album is another quixotic sonic parade; lo-fi yet lush, impenetrable yet wholly accessible, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is either the work of a genius or an utter crackpot, with the truth probably falling somewhere in between. Again teaming with producer Robert Schneider, Jeff Mangum invests the material here with new maturity and clarity; while the songs run continuously together, as they did on the previous On Avery Island, there is a much clearer sense of shifting dynamics from track to track, with a greater emphasis on structure and texture. Mangum's vocals are far more emotive as well; whether caught in the rush of spiritual epiphany (\"The King of Carrot Flowers Pts. Two and Three\") or in the grip of sexual anxiety (\"Two-Headed Boy\"), he sings with a new fervor, composed in equal measure of ecstasy and anguish. However, as his musical concepts continue to come into sharper focus, one hopes his stream-of-consciousness lyrical ideas soon begin to do the same; while Mangum spins his words with the rapid-fire intensity of a young Dylan, the songs are far too cryptic and abstract to fully sink in -- In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is undoubtedly a major statement, but just what it's saying is anyone's guess. ~ Jason Ankeny",

Falling somewhere between Cat Power, Carole King, and Linda Ronstadt, Ford's sophomore outing dials back on some of the on the nose, soul-pop contrivances of 2010's Obadiah, which while solid and surprising enough at the time, at this point sounds more like an abandoned set of blueprints for what would eventually become Indian Ocean. The songs and performances are altogether more confident, due in large part to the near constant presence of some talented guests, most notably the aforementioned sibling soul alchemists Charles Hodges (organ), Leroy Hodges (bass), and Teenie Hodges (guitar), the latter of whom passed away during the recording of the album, and standout cuts like the world weary \"September Fields,\" the bluesy and evocative \"Runnin',\" the gospel-tinged \"Season After Season,\" and the epic and elegiac title track bring with them a patina of pure, tube-driven, smoky goodness that surrounds the listener in a cloud of nostalgia that yields no obvious compass points. Indian Ocean is sad, sweet, and warm as an August afternoon, and while its charms may feel old-fashioned and better suited to vinyl, the hardships it details are undeniably contemporary, and their conclusions oddly comforting. [Indian Ocean was also released on LP.] ~ James Christopher Monger",

Apart from retailing for a price lower than the sum of the two discs bought separately, there's nothing special about the package. It consists of the two CDs, as they were originally released, inside a thin cardboard shell that isn't particularly attractive. Four years after this set's release, Thriller was given an elaborate 25th anniversary overhaul (with updates of certain songs featuring the likes of Akon, will.i.am, Fergie, and Kanye West), but the version included here will do just fine for any casual fan. ~ Andy Kellman",

        "summary": "The Kooks arrived fully formed in 2006, for their debut sounds like the work of a band well into its career: the confidence with which the foursome from Brighton play and the abandon with which Luke Pritchard sings; the witty songcraft and deft arrangements; the drama and fervor they unleash from the very first notes and carry through to the end. They display maturity but also play with the fervor of kids and project a wide-eyed charm that is very endearing. On most of Inside In/Inside Out, the band sounds like a more energetic Thrills or a looser Sam Roberts Band, maybe even a less severe Arctic Monkeys at times. Along with these modern kinships and influences, the band is heavily indebted to classic rock. Traces of Thin Lizzy's romantic lyricism pop up on tracks like \"Eddie's Gun,\" and so does a bit of post-punk spikiness on \"You Don't Love Me,\" some Dexys singalong booziness on \"She Moves in Her Own Way,\" and a hint of jam-band funk on \"Match Box.\" Quite varied influences, and in the end the band sounds like the Kooks and no one else. A nice and unique sound doesn't mean much without some songs to fill it out, and the Kooks deliver plenty of memorable tunes. \"Eddie's Gun,\" \"See the World,\" the unfortunately named \"Jackie Big Tits,\" and \"Ooh La\" are very strong and, taken together, equal the output of just about any pop/rock band around in 2006. The only song that falls flat is the over-long reggae-rocker \"Time Awaits.\" It's the only track that breaks the four-minute mark, and it shows that the Kooks' strength isn't stretching out and jamming; their chops are best suited for short, sharp blasts of invigorating pop/rock. When they stick to that, the Kooks are an exciting, very promising band, and Inside In/Inside Out is an excellent debut. [Inside In/Inside Out was released on LP in 2016.] ~ Tim Sendra",

        "summary": "It's a beautiful thing to know that Brian Wilson is still alive and well in the kingdom of indie rock. My Morning Jacket's third full-length effort, and first for the ATO/RCA venture label, is a step beyond the band's work for Darla. While the gorgeous amalgam of the Band's vision of country/Americana and Neil Young's blend of folk and rock are everywhere present, there is a new textural awareness evident on It Still Moves. Jim James' songwriting is tighter in structure, but his production sensibility is early-'70s Laurel Canyon, with some of the Grateful Dead's American Beauty tropes as well. Sounds like a mess, doesn't it? Well, it's not. Wearing your influences on your sleeve doesn't mean unoriginality. James is an original songwriter; he has worked hard to develop the gifts inherent in his lyric concerns and his ability to paint emotional landscapes with his melodies, and the payoff has never been greater. \"Mahgeetah,\" with its Pet Sounds ambience and country-rock melody -- complete with fuzzed-out guitar solo -- is far more imaginative than anything Wilco ever pulled off by trying the same thing (which they do over and over ad nauseam). \"Dancefloors,\" with its biting Telecaster lead line that echoes \"Baby Don't Do It\" and the Stray Gators' country majesty, is full of warmth, depth, and Levon Helm's soul. And \"Golden,\" which is the third track in this opening triad, brings James' love of Tim Buckley and Fred Neil into the light. But all of these elements of construction are read through James' Kentucky and his unique melodic gift, where fragments becomes entire lines become songs with stunning bridges, achingly poetic lyrics, and a country boy's sense of whacked-out humor and tenderness (check out \"One Big Holiday\"). The horn arrangements on \"Easy Morning Rebel\" make the country shuffle into a near R&B tune with an old-timey stroll through a shambolic rhythm track. In all, My Morning Jacket may be a journey through the past, but it's also a solid step into something rock & roll has been missing for an awfully long time in the mainstream arena: melody, extremely catchy and well-written songs that aren't afraid of the mainstream, and a love of the great pop continuum that translates into something new. [A 2016 CD re-release added a bonus disc with 13 demos.] ~ Thom Jurek",

        "parentTitle": "The Isley Brothers",
        "summary": "In a way, the Isley Brothers have been taken for granted. Part of that is the group's unwitting doing because they were exceptionally steady. From 1966 through 1983, the Isleys placed at least one single on the Billboard R&B chart each year. They were always present, frequently at or near the top. For an extended period, they were among the most progressive groups, whether they were mixing gospel, soul, and rock, incorporating synthesizers without sacrificing the funk, covering pop hits and often surpassing them, or epitomizing quiet storm. When they retreated from the fore, they adapted with ease. Another factor in their undervalued status is that their vast discography has been reissued in chunks by various sources across the decades. The RCA Victor & T-Neck Album Masters: 1959-1983, released by the Sony catalog's Legacy division, is a corrective measure in the form of a compact 23-disc box set. It doesn't cover the Isleys' brief '60s stints with Wand, United Artists, and Tamla, but it is remarkably generous with dozens of bonus tracks -- mono versions, single edits, instrumentals, and so forth -- and LP-replica sleeves for each album. As an extra enticement for those who dutifully rounded up those late-'90s Legacy and early-2010s BBR reissues, there's Wild in Woodstock, a previously unreleased recording of the Go All the Way-era band performing at Bearsville Studios. Intended for release with overdubbed crowd noise that was thankfully never applied, the set alternates between blistering and gliding and deserves a release outside the box. ~ Andy Kellman",

        "summary": "San Fermin's self-titled 2013 debut was a heady brew of densely constructed chamber pop, the more abstract moments of the hour-long journey broken up with occasional bursts of more straightforward catchiness. The entire album was masterminded by Ellis Ludwig-Leone after completing a composition program at Yale, calling on various studio players and the vocal talents of Allen Tate and singing ensemble Lucius to bring his intricate vision to life. Following the critical acclaim the album drew, a live version of San Fermin toured extensively before Ludwig-Leone regrouped for follow-up sophomore effort Jackrabbit, which embraced more of the concise pop elements of the debut than its classical or chamber leanings. Where San Fermin felt like an ornate masterpiece intricately assembled in a lab somewhere, Jackrabbit has the sound of amplified confidence and enhanced group playing that comes from nightly live performance. The songs are still boisterous and triumphant, with tunes like the bounding title track and the tense and driving \"Woman in Red\" stuffed full of colorful sounds but still stripped down in comparison to the saturated orchestration of the first album. Overdriven drum sounds, acrobatic vocals, understated electronics, and horn sections all equate to an enormous pop sound on album standouts like \"Emily\" and \"Ladies Mary,\" pushing melody and groove to the forefront of the album, though semi-experimental classical impulses still show up in moments like the theatrical interlude \"Ecstatic Thoughts\" and the chorally driven \"Two Scenes.\" Tate's low and dusty voice still guides many of the album's storytelling songs. Gruesome imagery in the lyrics of album-opener \"The Woods\" are delivered in a Bill Callahan-like drawl, juxtaposing horrific descriptions of insects and mythical monstrosities with gentle, patient guitar strums and spare strains of piano. Replacing the female vocals of Lucius is touring vocalist Charlene Kaye, whose distant voice runs between metered verses and edgy, distorting crescendos on slinky tracks like \"Philosopher.\" Still rampant with huge statements and arrangements that bubble over and recede on almost every song, Jackrabbit sees San Fermin sounding less like a studio project and more like a band. The performances are strident and lean, suggesting the players are every bit as invested in delivering the best reading of Ludwig-Leone's complex and often gorgeous songs as he was inspired in creating them. ~ Fred Thomas",

        "parentTitle": "James Blake",
        "summary": "During 2009 and 2010, James Blake issued a clutch of abstract dubstep singles on Hemlock, Hessle Audio, and R&S. Each release increased anticipation for the producerâs next move as he continually shuffled the deck on his bristly, off-center, and generally groove-less tracks, some of which incorporated vocals -- he sampled Kelis and Aaliyah on âCMYK,â for instance -- or his own voice, heavily processed. The Klavierwerke EP, the last in the series, was the most stripped down of the bunch. The day after it was released, Blake uploaded a video for his dramatic cover version of Feistâs âLimit to Your Love,â which indicated that the focus on his voice and sparse backing would continue. Consisting of Blake's pensive vocal, a simple but affecting piano, and recurring beat weighed down by sub-bass, itâs one of the most straightforward tracks on Blakeâs brief debut album. The following âGive Me My Monthâ deviates most from Blakeâs vinyl output; itâs a wistful piano-and-voice ballad that has far more in common with Procol Harum than any given contemporary linked to Blake. The rest of the tracks are more like exercises in sound manipulation and reduction than songs. The approach is no fault, but Blake pares it down to such an extent that the material occasionally sounds not just tentative but feeble, fatigued, even, as on âI Never Learnt to Share,â where one creaky line is repeated and treated throughout, placed over swelling synthesizer frequencies and a stamping beat. âThe Wilhelm Scream,â one of the albumâs highlights, is far more effective, a ballad with a pulse that increases in intensity with skillfully deployed reverb and surging waves of soft noise. [An LP version was also released.] ~ Andy Kellman",

        "summary": "Johnny Cash's first album, released on Sun in 1957, is a little more folkloric and traditional than what he put on most of his singles, though not pronouncedly so. In fact, four of the tracks (\"I Walk the Line,\" \"Cry! Cry! Cry!,\" \"So Doggone Lonesome,\" and \"Folsom Prison Blues\") had already been hit singles. For the rest of the set, Cash drew on some older folk (\"Rock Island Line,\" \"The Wreck of the Old '97\"), country (\"[I Heard That] Lonesome Whistle,\" \"Remember Me [I'm the One Who Loves You]\"), prison (\"Doin' My Time\"), and spiritual (\"I Was There When It Happened\") songs. Filling out the set is a good, rollicking Cash original, \"Country Boy,\" and a rather sassy tune by the young Jerry Reed, \"If the Good Lord's Willing.\" It's a good, solid record that's very much in the mold of his classic early Sun sound, with spare accompaniment that nevertheless often approaches a rockabilly-country bounce. ~ Richie Unterberger",

        "summary": "Using the textured sonics of The Unforgettable Fire as a basis, U2 expanded those innovations by scaling back the songs to a personal setting and adding a grittier attack for its follow-up, The Joshua Tree. It's a move that returns them to the sweeping, anthemic rock of War, but if War was an exploding political bomb, The Joshua Tree is a journey through its aftermath, trying to find sense and hope in the desperation. That means that even the anthems -- the epic opener \"Where the Streets Have No Name,\" the yearning \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" -- have seeds of doubt within their soaring choruses, and those fears take root throughout the album, whether it's in the mournful sliding acoustic guitars of \"Running to Stand Still,\" the surging \"One Tree Hill,\" or the hypnotic elegy \"Mothers of the Disappeared.\" So it might seem a little ironic that U2 became superstars on the back of such a dark record, but their focus has never been clearer, nor has their music been catchier, than on The Joshua Tree. Unexpectedly, U2 have also tempered their textural post-punk with American influences. Not only are Bono's lyrics obsessed with America, but country and blues influences are heard throughout the record, and instead of using these as roots, they're used as ways to add texture to the music. With the uniformly excellent songs -- only the clumsy, heavy rock and portentous lyrics of \"Bullet the Blue Sky\" fall flat -- the result is a powerful, uncompromising record that became a hit due to its vision and its melody. Never before have U2's big messages sounded so direct and personal. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "On his last couple of Warner Bros albums, Gorilla and In the Pocket, James Taylor seemed to be converting himself from the shrinking violet, too-sensitive-to-live \"rainy day man\" of his early records into a mainstream, easy listening crooner with a sunny outlook. JT, his debut album for Columbia, was something of a defense of this conversion. Returning to the autobiographical, Taylor declared his love for Carly Simon (\"There We Are\"), but expressed some surprise at his domestic bliss. \"Isn't it amazing a man like me can feel this way?\" he sang in the opening song, \"Your Smiling Face\" (a Top 40 hit). At the same time, domesticity could have its temporary depressions (\"Another Grey Morning\"). The key track was \"Secret O' Life,\" which Taylor revealed as \"enjoying the passage of time.\" Working with his long-time backup band of Danny Kortchmar, Leland Sklar, and Russell Kunkel, and with Peter Asher back in the producer's chair, Taylor also enjoyed mixing his patented acoustic guitar-based folk sound with elements of rock, blues, and country. He even made the country charts briefly with \"Bartender's Blues,\" a genre exercise complete with steel guitar and references to \"honky tonk angels\" that he would later re-record with George Jones. The album's Top Ten hit was Taylor's winning remake of Jimmy Jones' \"Handy Man,\" which replaced the grit of the original with his characteristic warmth. JT was James Taylor's best album since Mud Slide Slim & the Blue Horizon because it acknowledged the darkness of his earlier work while explaining the deliberate lightness of his current viewpoint, and because it was his most consistent collection in years. Fans responded: JT sold better than any Taylor album since Sweet Baby James. ~ William Ruhlmann",

        "summary": "The success of Saturdays = Youth and Hurry Up, We're Dreaming led M83's Anthony Gonzalez to even bigger, arguably less personal, projects like his score for the 2013 sci-fi blockbuster Oblivion, so it's no surprise that he reclaims his independence -- sometimes willfully so -- on Junk. With the audacious opener \"Do It, Try It,\" a fantasia of tweaked vocals, slap bass, and unapologetically cheap-sounding MIDI piano, he and Justin Meldal-Johnsen let listeners know that the sequel to \"Midnight City\" isn't happening here. Instead, they deliver a love letter to vintage schmaltz that finds the treasure in what many consider trash. If Saturdays = Youth was a sweeping tone poem to the glamour of John Hughes' '80s, then Junk's look and sound prove M83 is just as devoted to the decade's decidedly uncool side. The album's artwork is bedecked with shaggy puppets that look like The Great Space Coaster rejects and scrawled lettering straight out of Punky Brewster, and Gonzalez and Meldal-Johnsen revel in their musical equivalents: the harmonica solo on \"Sunday Night 1987\" -- a title that distills Junk's mood and inspiration perfectly -- hasn't been used in such a genuine fashion since 1987. \"Bibi the Dog\" shows the era's Europop novelties some love, while \"Moon Crystal\"'s perky strings, brass, and keys are equally breezy and comforting, evoking a world lit only by the glow of a TV set. Elsewhere, the panoramic synths of M83's earlier work are traded for sharp-edged, aggressively digital sounds that connect less overtly retro moments like \"Walkway Blues\" and the high-octane romance of \"Go!\" and \"Road Blaster\" to the rest of the album. Junk's cultural dumpster-diving works so well because it's done with lots of love and zero irony. As Gonzalez mourns lost times, people, and sounds, the album's poignancy feels more genuine than its influences: the syrupy, borderline maudlin \"For the Kids\" could've been recorded by Bette Midler or Dionne Warwick for an animated kids' movie back in the day, but also lays bare the wide-eyed sentimentality of M83's earlier music. Meanwhile, \"Solitude\" and \"Time Wind,\" a collaboration with Beck, capture the feeling of being small and lonely in a big world thanks to their sweeping arrangements, which feel as indebted to his work as a composer as they do to the 1980s' fondness for orchestral pop. Much like Daft Punk's Random Access Memories, Junk looks back in a way that's so accomplished that it's difficult to call it a retreat. Instead, it feels like a reminder that Gonzalez is dedicated to making music on his own terms, even if the results are polarizing. While all listeners may not share his fascination with '80s pop culture detritus, it's hard not to respect how expertly he transforms it into something genuine.

        "summary": "Smarting from Dazzle Ships' commercial failure, the band had a bit of a rethink when it came to their fifth album -- happily, the end result showed that the group was still firing on all fours. While very much a pop-oriented album and a clear retreat from the exploratory reaches of previous work, Junk Culture was no sacrifice of ideals in pursuit of cash. In comparison to the group's late-'80s work, when it seemed commercial success was all that mattered, Junk Culture exhibits all the best qualities of OMD at their most accessible -- instantly memorable melodies and McCluskey's distinct singing voice, clever but emotional lyrics, and fine playing all around. A string of winning singles didn't hurt, to be sure; indeed, opening number \"Tesla Girls\" is easily the group's high point when it comes to sheer sprightly pop, as perfect a tribute to obvious OMD inspirational source Sparks as any -- witty lines about science and romance wedded to a great melody (prefaced by a brilliant, hyperactive intro). \"Locomotion\" takes a slightly slower but equally entertaining turn, sneaking in a bit of steel drum to the appropriately chugging rhythm and letting the guest horn section take a prominent role, its sunny blasts offsetting the deceptively downcast lines McCluskey sings. Meanwhile, \"Talking Loud and Clear\" ends the record on a reflective note -- Cooper's intra-verse sax lines and mock harp snaking through the quiet groove of the song. As for the remainder of the album, if there are hints here and there of the less-successful late-'80s period, at other points the more adventurous side of the band steps up. The instrumental title track smoothly blends reggae rhythms with the haunting mock choirs familiar from earlier efforts, while the elegiac, Humphreys-sung \"Never Turn Away\" and McCluskey's \"Hard Day\" both make for lower-key highlights. [Junk Culture was re-released in 2015 as a two-disc set, adding 12\" versions and demos.]  ~ Ned Raggett",

After one album for Fairfax Recordings, Can't Get Past the Lips, in 2013, they went looking for a better home and found one with Dine Alone. Their second record, Just Enough Hip to Be Woman, captures much of the lovably dumb (in the best way) punk rock spirit of the debut, but also shows the band maturing and dialing down the rambunctious energy. Leading off with two tracks that sound like they could have come from Lips, \"What\" and the insanely hooky \"Class Historian,\" you might think a straight line is being drawn from one record to the next. True, the sound is measurably cleaner and more compact, but the punch and almost giddy drive of the debut is still there. From there, the band takes a detour into some midtempo mood pieces and ballads, before the ninth song provides a jolt. The rollicking and silly \"It's On,\" which was featured on Girls, is exactly the kind of rambunctious song BRONCHO excels at. ~ Tim Sendra",

        "summary": "The Decemberists' sixth, full-length studio outing finds the Portland, OR-based indie rock collective exploring a region that has thus far eluded them. Raised on a steady diet of Morrissey, Robyn Hitchcock, Shirley Collins, and Fairport Convention, The King Is Dead represents frontman Colin Meloy's first foray into the musical traditions of his homeland, or more specifically, it proves that he really, really likes R.E.M. âCalamity Song,â which is one of three tracks to feature guitar work from Peter Buck, threatens to break into âPretty Persuasionâ or \"So. Central Rain (Iâm Sorry)\" at any moment, and first single âDown by the Waterâ flirts with âThe One I Loveâ hard enough to take it on a long weekend, though Meloy has stated that the track âstarted out as more of a paean to R.E.M. than I think any of us really wanted it to.â David Rawlings and Gillian Welch also join the party on a number of tracks, lending their instantly recognizable voices to two of the albumâs finest moments, the Wildflowers-era, Tom Petty-inspired âDonât Carry It Allâ and the lovely, Paul Simon-esque âJune Hymnâ -- Meloy and Welch, the former a Montana-born Anglophile and the latter a California girl with a fetish for dust bowl Appalachia -- harmonize nicely, canceling out each otherâs vocal affectations. Itâs by far the clearest and most commercial collection of tunes the band has amassed to date, but itâs also the least interesting. It may sound like a cross between Camper Van Beethoven's Key Lime Pie and R.E.M.âs Automatic for the People, but none of the tracks have the gravitas or potential staying power of a song like âSweetheartsâ (CVP) or âFind the Riverâ (R.E.M.). That said, itâs a refreshing change from the usual compilation of bibliophile, sea shanty/murder ballad, and while the Led Zeppelin III-style rural overhauling may isolate fans who prefer the serpentine, progressive art rock of albums like The Crane Wife and Hazards of Love, it opens up a whole new continent for the band to explore. ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "Death Cab for Cutie's eighth full-length album, 2015's Kintsugi, finds the group sliding further into the studio smoothness that marked 2011's Codes and Keys. Produced by Rich Costey -- best-known for his work with Kimbra, Mew, Muse, Interpol, and Chvrches -- Kintsugi is also the last album Death Cab recorded with co-founding member Chris Walla, who announced he was leaving the band during the recording process. Sentiment has always been lead singer/songwriter Ben Gibbard's calling card, but as he starts to stare down the corridor to 40, he seems comfortable with leaving that open heart unadorned -- or, better still, gussied up in a coat of studio shellac. Although there are fragile solo numbers dotted throughout the album, most of Kintsugi shimmers upon a gloss constructed out of new wave remnants and faded memories of yacht rock. Conceivably, Gibbard's intent hews toward the latter -- such clean disco-rock diversions as \"Good Help (Is So Hard to Find)\" and the galloping collegiate rock echoes of \"El Dorado\" show a yen for art -- but his open heart nudges Kintsugi toward new millennial soft rock. This is a feature, not a bug. Gibbard has a gentle touch so having cushy, sugary melodies mirrored by a production equally as supple feels like a marriage of intent and sound. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "A victim of both overexposure and embracement from privileged hedonists around the globe, UB40's Labour of Love is still a near perfect album, one filled with warmth and an infectious love of the music it's covering. Then there's that reggae version of \"Red Red Wine\" that spills out of yachts, frat parties, soirees by the pool, water parks, and just about anywhere there are sun-seeking tourists. Delivered with a drunken sway, the band's cover of the Neil Diamond favorite also features a new toasted/rapped break in the middle, which comes courtesy of UB40 MC Astro and adds so much mirth and fun to the number that Diamond lifted it for his own live show. Even if omnipresence has since made it pop-reggae's \"Don't Worry Be Happy,\" the U.K. crew's version is in the Jamaican tradition of covering sweet, soothing tunes that pre-date lovers rock, plus the rest of this all-cover-versions album sticks with the classic reggae songbook, as even the Impressions' \"Keep on Moving\" is done in a style that honors the 1973 recording from Bob Marley & the Wailers. If \"Red Red Wine\" is effortless almost to a fault, Jimmy Cliff's \"Many Rivers to Cross\" is performed with full heart and can rock the soul's foundation, while \"Johnny Too Bad\" is just spiky enough to bring reminders of the group's birth in the time and land of post-punk. Everything else is A- at worst, and the end-to-end LP flow is classic while recontextualizing \"Red Red Wine\" for the better. Put it on at a party and spill beer on it if you must, because the resilient Labour of Love is true sweetness and light. [A two-LP, 18-track version was released in 2015.] ~ David Jeffries",

        "parentTitle": "Johnny Flynn",
        "summary": "Before listening to A Larum, it's worth noting that the album's cover is misleading as far as giving credit where it's due. Despite being under the name of vocalist, multi-instrumentalist, and lyricist Johnny Flynn, it would be unfair to deem this as a solo effort, given that he is the frontman for the South London folk group the Sussex Wit. The band is a collection of talented individuals in their own right, and they do more on A Larum than simply providing an aural backdrop for Flynn's witticisms. Rather, it quickly becomes clear that the Wit's intricate, meandering rhythms and melodies are a fitting complement to Flynn's straightforward delivery, augmenting lyrics that would also function as poetry outside of a musical setting. Songs such as \"Tickle Me Pink\" demand active listening (especially when lines like \"Tickle me pink and rosy as a flushed red apple skin/Except I've never been as sweet\" float by on breezily mischievous melodies), and such playfulness is hardly an anomaly here. In fact, it's far more rare to find tunes on A Larum that don't quite hit the mark, though slower numbers like \"Brown Trout Blues\" do have a tendency to drag. Fortunately, the bulk of the album is geared toward both Flynn's and the Wit's strengths -- gently rollicking tunes, engaging lyrics, warm vocal harmonies (courtesy of percussionist Matt Edmonds and Lillie Flynn), and well-timed instrumental interludes featuring horns (Johnny Flynn, Johnathan Salzman), strings (Johnny Flynn once again, with Joe Zeitlin), and the occasional pair of spoons (thanks to Artis the \"Spoonman\"). The tangible intimacy between Flynn and his group makes A Larum not only an introduction, but also captures the gentle, amicable nature that makes them such an inviting and satisfying listen. ~ Katherine Fulton",

        "summary": "As with the majority of the Late Night Tales mix CDs, German composer/pianist Nils Frahm's volume isn't a beatmatched DJ mix attempting to emulate a night out at a dance club, but rather a dreamlike sound collage highlighting inspirations and favorite items in the artist's record collection. Frahm takes a more surrealist bent than other contributors to the series, throwing in selections from his 78-rpm recording collection, layering in spoken word and classical pieces, and slowing down Boards of Canada by accident, but leaving it in because it sounds even more mysterious. Frahm starts the collection by jokingly covering John Cage's eternal think piece \"4'33\",\" but instead of four-and-a-half minutes of silence, he constructs a gentle, slowly paced piano melody, adding some delicate feedback toward the end. Dubby electronic tracks from System and Rhythm & Sound sit alongside jazz masterpieces by Miles Davis and Nina Simone, and a 1932 recording of \"Flight of the Bumble Bee\" (as well as a field recording of a friend's cat purring) lighten up the mood. The album ends with a chilling short story told by Irish actor Cillian Murphy, who concludes it by stating \"You have been listening to Late Night Tales, music and stories worth staying up for,\" providing a fitting end to this immersive hour-long dream sequence. ~ Paul Simpson",

        "summary": "Perfume Genius is a strangely perfect name for Mike Hadreas' music. Like scent, his songs are delicate but strong, faint yet persistent, and have a deep, almost inexplicable emotional pull. On his debut album, Learning, Hadreas comes across like the kid brother of Antony Hegarty or Xiu Xiu's Jamie Stewart, taking the vulnerability of a singer/songwriter to an extreme with messed-up and heartbreaking stories. Yet, despite Hadreas' shaky, at times barely audible vocals, thereâs an ease to his confessions that makes him unique; as uncomfortable as his subjects can be, he doesnât play them for shock value. Instead, he embraces the disturbing and the heartfelt equally, accepting that caring can be creepy with a matter-of-factness that makes it all the more powerful. Hadreas sings âItâs all part of his planâ over whirling synths on the album closer, âNever Did,â and itâs equally likely that heâs referring to a benevolent higher power or something more tangible and sinister. âMr. Petersonâ sketches out a friendship (possibly more) with a teacher and treats his suicide with evenhanded compassion: âI hope thereâs room for you up above or down below.â Learning gives its sometimes hard words soft surroundings, either cushioning them with ethereal synths and music boxes on âNo Problemâ or allowing his piano to reverberate around them with an almost hymnal quality, as on the bittersweet lullaby âWhen.â At times Hadreas' songs suggest personal notes or diary entries set to music -- not because theyâre too literal, but because of the emotional weight implied in them. He reveals only the smallest but most telling parts of his stories, playing cat and mouse with details and telling gaps: on âWrite to Your Brother,â the lyric âTell him mom treats you like a lover/That you have to hide all the mouthwash from herâ says it all. But what makes Hadreas' songwriting remarkable is the empathy he holds for his characters. âPerryâ does a chiaroscuro dance between hope and despair, but ends the song with the line âWhatever good is left/Put your trust in it/You know we already have.â As dark as Learningâs songs can get, it always feels like Hadreas wants the best for the people he sings about, and a good, ultimately hopeful kind of sadness permeates nearly every song. Not even half an hour long, Learning shows just what a strong impression music so fragile can make. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "On their first two albums, Led Zeppelin unleashed a relentless barrage of heavy blues and rockabilly riffs, but Led Zeppelin III provided the band with the necessary room to grow musically. While there are still a handful of metallic rockers, III is built on a folky, acoustic foundation that gives the music extra depth. And even the rockers aren't as straightforward as before: the galloping \"Immigrant Song\" is powered by Robert Plant's banshee wail, \"Celebration Day\" turns blues-rock inside out with a warped slide guitar riff, and \"Out on the Tiles\" lumbers along with a tricky, multi-part riff. Nevertheless, the heart of the album lies on the second side, when the band delve deeply into English folk. \"Gallows Pole\" updates a traditional tune with a menacing flair, and \"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\" is an infectious acoustic romp, while \"That's the Way\" and \"Tangerine\" are shimmering songs with graceful country flourishes. The band hasn't left the blues behind, but the twisted bottleneck blues of \"Hats off to (Roy) Harper\" actually outstrips the epic \"Since I've Been Loving You,\" which is the only time Zeppelin sound a bit set in their ways.

        "summary": "Encompassing heavy metal, folk, pure rock & roll, and blues, Led Zeppelin's untitled fourth album is a monolithic record, defining not only Led Zeppelin but the sound and style of '70s hard rock. Expanding on the breakthroughs of III, Zeppelin fuse their majestic hard rock with a mystical, rural English folk that gives the record an epic scope. Even at its most basic -- the muscular, traditionalist \"Rock and Roll\" -- the album has a grand sense of drama, which is only deepened by Robert Plant's burgeoning obsession with mythology, religion, and the occult. Plant's mysticism comes to a head on the eerie folk ballad \"The Battle of Evermore,\" a mandolin-driven song with haunting vocals from Sandy Denny, and on the epic \"Stairway to Heaven.\" Of all of Zeppelin's songs, \"Stairway to Heaven\" is the most famous, and not unjustly. Building from a simple fingerpicked acoustic guitar to a storming torrent of guitar riffs and solos, it encapsulates the entire album in one song. Which, of course, isn't discounting the rest of the album. \"Going to California\" is the group's best folk song, and the rockers are endlessly inventive, whether it's the complex, multi-layered \"Black Dog,\" the pounding hippie satire \"Misty Mountain Hop,\" or the funky riffs of \"Four Sticks.\" But the closer, \"When the Levee Breaks,\" is the one song truly equal to \"Stairway,\" helping give IV the feeling of an epic. An apocalyptic slice of urban blues, \"When the Levee Breaks\" is as forceful and frightening as Zeppelin ever got, and its seismic rhythms and layered dynamics illustrate why none of their imitators could ever equal them. \r\n[Led Zeppelin launched a massive, Jimmy Page-supervised reissue campaign in 2014, where each of their studio albums was remastered and then expanded with a bonus disc of alternate versions (in the case of the super deluxe editions, they were also supplemented by vinyl pressings and a massive hardcover book). The supplemental disc for Led Zeppelin IV is constructed as a mirror image of the finished album, comprised almost entirely of alternate mixes and instrumentals. \"The Battle of Evermore\" and \"Going to California\" belong to the latter category, consisting of nothing but the acoustic guitar and mandolin parts from the finished track, while the rest of the record is devoted to alternate mixes from various sources. Occasionally, a distinction leaps out -- there's a notable lack of swampy, cavernous echo on \"When the Levee Breaks,\" perhaps a few more keyboards on the midsection of \"Stairway to Heaven\" -- but generally these mixes are leaner, tighter, and not all that different from the finished version. A song or two feels slightly different -- \"Misty Mountain Hop\" jumps a bit as it seems to groove a little bit harder -- but by and large this disc shows that as a producer, Page not only knew where he wanted to go but he knew how to get it right the first time.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Eleven years after his solo debut, Norwegian singer/songwriter Erlend Ãye returns with the winsome and laid-back Legao. Much has changed for the charismatic singer who, at the time of his 2003 debut, was in the midst of a deep electronic phase which was conversely bookended by two fine acoustic albums from his primary outlet, the folk-pop duo Kings of Convenience. While Legao is something new altogether, it has far more in common with Kings' quiet, bookish ballads than with the pulsing electro and disco jams of his first solo dalliance. Now based in Sicily, the worldly Ãye traveled to ReykjavÃ­k to record Legao (a Portuguese word which basically translates to \"great\" or \"cool\") with Icelandic reggae band HjÃ¡lmar. At first blush, his gently sunny guitar pop seems pleasant if slightly unassuming. But there is something in Ãye's character, a sort of world-weary kindness, that eventually draws you in. With its bright, clean production and indie-island pulse, Legao shines a warm light onto Ãye's wistful Nordic melancholia resulting in the kind of record that could either bring comfort on a winter's day or hang back on a sun-baked car radio with the windows down. It's romantic, bittersweet, uplifting, and occasionally sad, but a charmer in all aspects. From the softly upbeat opener \"Fence Me In\" to the big-hearted percolations of \"Rainman,\" Ãye and his crew invite you on a very human journey and it's easy to get swept along. Standouts like \"Bad Guy Now\" and the elegant piano ballad \"Who Do You Report To\" showcase the polite vulnerability that makes Ãye so appealing as both a singer and a songsmith. As collaborators, HjÃ¡lmar were well-chosen and guitarist Portsteinn Einarsson in particular delivers some sparkling and inventive guitar work throughout. Perhaps Legao doesn't have the gritty pathos and mystique that so often causes an album to be flagged as an \"important work,\" but it's a pure and honest work, and one you want to spend some time with. [Legao was also released on LP.] ~ Timothy Monger",

And it does that remarkably well, offering all of his genre-defying greats and an illustration of his excellence, warmth, and humanity. In a way, it is perfect since it gives a doubter or casual fan anything they could want. Let's face it, the beauty and simplicity of Marley's music was as important as his message, and that's captured particularly well here.

        "summary": "Mostly recorded without Brian Jones -- who died several months before its release (although he does play on two tracks) and was replaced by Mick Taylor (who also plays on just two songs) -- Let It Bleed extends the rock and blues feel of Beggars Banquet into slightly harder-rocking, more demonically sexual territory. The Rolling Stones were never as consistent on album as their main rivals, the Beatles, and Let It Bleed suffers from some rather perfunctory tracks, like \"Monkey Man\" and a countrified remake of the classic \"Honky Tonk Woman\" (here titled \"Country Honk\"). Yet some of the songs are among their very best, especially \"Gimme Shelter,\" with its shimmering guitar lines and apocalyptic lyrics; the harmonica-driven \"Midnight Rambler\"; the druggy party ambience of the title track; and the stunning \"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\" which was the Stones' \"Hey Jude\" of sorts, with its epic structure, horns, philosophical lyrics, and swelling choral vocals. \"You Got the Silver\" (Keith Richards' first lead vocal) and Robert Johnson's \"Love in Vain,\" by contrast, were as close to the roots of acoustic down-home blues as the Stones ever got. ~ Richie Unterberger",

        "parentTitle": "Diana Ross & The Supremes",
        "summary": "This limited-edition anthology spotlights an impressive four-dozen previously unissued Diana Ross & the Supremes' selections from the seemingly infinite Motown archives. Of course there have been similarly copious collections of vintage Supremes' rarities, outtakes, remixes, and the like; most notably the highly collectable 25th Anniversary (1986) and Never Before Released Masters (1987), not to mention a plethora of additional multi-artist packages and expanded editions of classic Supremes' long-players. With such a myriad of previous outlets, one could easily presume that these 48 tracks are scraping the bottom of the proverbial barrel. Luckily for aficionados and enthusiasts of Florence Ballard, Diana Ross, and Mary Wilson, there seems to be plenty of quality leftovers -- some of which weren't even known about until the set's producers began their research on Let the Music Play: Supreme Rarities 1960-1969. Taking a chronological approach, the album begins with \"(You Can) Depend on Me,\" one of the very first sides to have been recorded by the ladies. The number was co-written by Motown founder Berry Gordy and William \"Smokey\" Robinson, and actually predates the vocalists' \"official\" Motown signing. Similarly, the title \"Tears of Sorrow\" had been documented by the pre-Supremes' prototype, the Primettes, for a different label. (Barbara Martin was still in the group at this point and, as Andrew Skurow points out in his song-by-song annotations, she can clearly be heard on \"Because I Love Him,\" which is among the sides that Gordy penned specifically for the Supremes.) Among his additional contributions are \"Hey Baby (Version 1),\" \"Too Hot (Version 4),\" \"You're Gonna Come to Me,\" -- presented in two separate incarnations -- and \"Come on Boy.\" All are offered from Gordy in the days before Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Eddie Holland, Jr. began churning out the the Supremes' chart-toppers. A prime example of their prowess can be found on the appropriately titled \"Hits Medley: Come See About Me/Baby Love/Stop! In the Name of Love,\" which was worked up for the Supremes to lip-sync to during their high-profile appearance in the June 28, 1965 premiere episode of Dick Clark's teen-oriented rock & roll performance show Where the Action Is.\r\nThroughout their career, the Supremes covered a wide spectrum of artists and Supreme Rarities includes some interesting non-Motown material. From the world of rock & roll are the Beatles' \" I Saw Him (Her) Standing There\" and Buddy Holly's \"Not Fade Away,\" -- initially meant for the A Bit of Liverpool project -- Sam Cooke's \"Cupid,\" Tom Jones' \"It's Not Unusual,\" the Rolling Stones' \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,\" Bacharach and David's \"The Look of Love,\" and Jimmy Webb's \"MacArthur Park.\" They join the Bob Merrill/Jule Styne show tune \"People,\" \"Somewhere over the Rainbow,\" and overhauls of pop standards \"Canadian Sunset\" and \"Autumn Leaves\" -- all of which were unbelievably relegated to the cutting-room floor. As were the Supremes' interpretation of fellow label mates the Miracles (\"Mickey's Monkey\"), the Vandellas (\"Come And Get These Memories\"), Stevie Wonder (\"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\") and the Four Tops (\"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch)\"). There are even alternates of a few well-known Supremes' tracks with \"Back in My Arms Again,\" \"You Can't Hurry Love,\" \"I'll Set You Free,\" and \"Love Child\" being the best examples. The two CDs are visually augmented with lots of photos within the 32-page liner notes booklet that is likewise packed with interesting bits of trivia and discographical details thanks to Skurow's text. ~ Lindsay Planer",

        "summary": "Life for Rent doesn't offer anything that drastically different from Dido's debut album, No Angel -- the dance beats are marginally fresher, the production is clean and new -- but this predictibility is actually rather refreshing because the album delivers on its promise, unlike many sophomore affairs in 2003. That its promise is rather modest doesn't really matter, since Dido is successful at modest songs. She has a sweet, warm voice and a knack for tuneful modern folk-pop that sounds intimate while being confidently catchy and nicely atmospheric. In other words, it retains the feel of No Angel and its two big hits, \"Here With Me\" and \"Thank You,\" without ever rewriting either song, but contributing songs like \"White Flag,\" \"Stoned,\" \"Life for Rent,\" and \"Do You Have a Little Time,\" which are nearly as memorable. The appeal of Life for Rent is what makes Dido appealing -- she's unassuming and gentle, but her songs are so melodic and atmospheric they easily work their way into the subconscious, and the records are well-crafted enough to be engaging on repeated plays. So, Life for Rent isn't much different than its predecessor, but that's a very good thing in this case. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Jupiter One co-founder and frequent Of Montreal merrymaker K Ishibashi's second go-around under the Kishi Bashi moniker is as lavish and fanciful an affair as its flamboyant cover art would suggest, offering up a bountiful 14-track set of dense, multi-hued indie pop confections that lands somewhere between the clubby, blissed-out glow of \"Sleepyhead\"-era Passion Pit, the bedazzled Icelandic fairy realm of JÃ³nsi, and the neon green fields of the Teletubbies. Ishibashi's violin steers the needle through a tapestry of classical-infused electro-pop that's as dense as it is effervescent; looping, pitch-shifting, arpeggiating, and swirling about like a fly drowning fitfully in a vat of simple syrup. Lighght requires a sweet tooth, but at least it lets you know what to expect early on, thanks to the criminally sugary, one-two punch of \"Philosophize in It! Chemicalize with It!\" and \"The Ballad of Mr. Steak,\" the latter of which builds to an earworm of a chorus that declares \"Mr. Steak, you are grade A.\" Ishibashi follows suit with the meaty \"Carry on Phenomenon,\" a lyrically impenetrable, impossibly catchy blast of ELO worship that, like all of the songs on the tightly packed rainbow canon that is Lighght, skillfully applies a dizzying array of bells and whistles to what is essentially a simple, relatable, and reliable pop melody. Whether he's flirting with Incredible String Band aloofness (\"Q&A\"), getting sucked into a whirlpool of loopy, island pizzicato (\"One Upon a Lucid Dream [In Afrikaans]\"), or just reveling in the sheer, ridiculous ornateness of the world he has created (\"Song for the Sold\"), he's doing so without the encumbrance of subterfuge. For Ishibashi, even the finery is from the heart. [A Japanese release of Lighght added three bonus tracks: \"I'll Grow a Garden,\" \"I'll See You There,\" and \"Song for the Sold.\"] ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "Ingrid Michaelson's sixth studio album, 2014's Lights Out, is a polished, well-produced effort that magnifies all of the sounds and lyrical themes she's been working with since breaking through with 2007's Girls and Boys. Michaelson even seems to reference that album with her Lights Out lead single, the infectious \"Girls Chase Boys.\" However, where Girls and Boys centered around Michaelson's intimate ukulele and acoustic guitar-driven dorm room pop, Lights Out features a broadened sonic palette and a much more robust vocal performance; it's a transformation she's been perfecting since 2009's Everybody and 2012's Human Again. This time out, Michaelson has enlisted a handful of producers who include, among others, her bandmate bassist Chris Kuffner, Jacquire King (Modest Mouse, Norah Jones), and singer/songwriter Katie Herzig. Michaelson even reunites with longtime collaborator Dan Romer for the epic ballad \"Over You,\" featuring A Great Big World. While there are a few of Michaelson's trademark intimate breakup songs here, including the tear-inducing \"Open Hands,\" overall the album reveals Michaelson to be in a bright, upbeat state of mind. Cuts like the bluesy, handclap-heavy \"Warpath\" and the similarly fiery \"Time Machine,\" with its '90s-esque sax samples, are more emblematic of the album's ambitious, empowered tone. Elsewhere, we get the catchy dance-pop duet \"One Night Town\" with Mat Kearney and the uplifting anthem \"Afterlife.\" There's also a very in-the-moment feeling of both poignancy and happiness to Lights Out, which is perhaps best expressed in the midtempo Beatlesque ballad \"Wonderful Unknown,\" featuring Michaelson's husband, singer/songwriter Greg Laswell. In it, Michaelson ruminates on the small details of her everyday life, singing \"We make bread on Sundays and the little ones are climbing the walls/Up the walls/Nothing lasts forever but the sound of love astounds me every time that it calls.\" Ultimately, on Lights Out, Michaelson has captured that sound of love. [Lights Out was also released with six bonus tracks.] ~ Matt Collar",

        "summary": "Lucy Rose is as much the folky, doe-eyed country girl as her striking debut Like I Used To makes her out to be. The British songstress first found success as the female voice on Bombay Bicycle Club's albums Flaws (2010) and A Different Kind of Fix (2011), and it wasnât long before Rose emerged as a solo artist in her own right. Although the Bombay Bicycle Club involvement gave her a leg up, Roseâs success came through her hard work, dedication, and heart-wrenching songs. As all of her previous recorded music came from a series of videos, this debut full-length sees many of her established songs committed to tape for the first time, to the delight of her loyal followers. Although Rose follows a well-trod path in the creation of her music, what sets her apart is the manner and execution of her heartfelt lyrics and gently strummed songs, which sound sincere and familiar. There is no fear of holding back, either, as Rose tumbles from song to song. âShiverâ captures the raw emotions of a broken relationship; the following âNightbusâ portrays a lonely, confused journey home on the last bus through the streets of London. Although many of the emotions here deal in heartbreak, loneliness, and fear (see also âRed Face,â âMiddle of the Bed,â or âFirstâ) Rose manages to muster some positivity for the surprisingly upbeat âBikes,â which even includes a wonderful xylophone solo. Her sweet, wistful vocals inevitably evoke comparisons to English folk contemporaries Laura Marling and Emmy the Great, but this is where the comparisons end. Roseâs musicianship is backed by her talented band, and together they create an album full of raw emotion and elegant melodies -- helped somewhat by the albumâs unconventional recording. Initially -- before signing to Columbia Records -- Rose recorded independently and on a shoestring budget; she decided to take her band to her hometown in Warwickshire and record in her parentâs country house, the nuclear bunker in the basement and the local village hall. This lends a warm, homey feel to the album, which can be heard on the album closer âBe Alrightâ -- which atones somewhat for the heartbreak that consumes much of the record -- ending the record on a slightly more optimistic note. For her loyal fans, Roseâs debut release has been a long time coming, and they will not be disappointed by the beautifully constructed storytelling she has delivered here.

        "parentTitle": "The Acid",
        "summary": "Even if they're not billed as a supergroup, the Acid's three members boast a formidable amount of talent (and other projects): producer/DJ Adam Freeland scored a hit single with 2003's breakbeat-driven \"We Want Your Soul\" and remixed songs by Orbital and Silversun Pickups, among others; singer/songwriter Ryan Cuming makes heartfelt, intimate music as Ry X and indietronic fare as one half of Howling; and Steve Nalepa is a producer, composer, and professor of music technology. This wealth of skills and experience could have led to similarly overstuffed music, but the trio's full-length debut, Liminal, is remarkably restrained in its ever-shifting balance of indie, dance, and R&B. Indeed, the songs that first appeared on the Acid's self-titled EP sound downright lush compared to how spare and sculpted the rest the album is. \"Animal\" pairs the chiming, Durutti Column-esque guitars that have become a hallmark of this style with revving synths that sound like one part dubstep and one part motorcycle, while \"Fame,\" with its beautiful juxtaposition of fizzy warmth and cool tones, might still be the Acid's most immediately engaging song. Tracks like these offer a gateway to more implosive moments such as \"Clean\" and \"Red,\" both of which deliver graceful, elongated ebbs and flows that are miles away from the epic drops expected of 2010s dance music. The way the Acid incorporate elements of house and dubstep on Liminal borders on dream logic, particularly on \"Veda,\" where a distant four-on-the-floor beat propels its meditations. Of course, they aren't the only ones fusing these sounds; How to Dress Well, the xx, and James Blake are just some of the most prominent artists working in similar territory. However, Freeland, Nalepa, and Cuming may be the most eclectic in comparison to their contemporaries. Since the Acid boast two accomplished producers, Liminal always sounds intriguing, whether it's the sleek yet feral atmosphere of \"Tumbling Lights,\" which evokes walking through a jungle at night, or the subtle building and blending of acoustic and electronic textures on \"Basic Instinct\" and \"Ra.\" Cuming's melancholic, Thom Yorke-like tenor is the fulcrum for these explorations, and he sounds at home in whatever backdrops Freeland and Nalepa give him. Cuming's storytelling also helps the Acid distinguish themselves from their peers, particularly on the aptly named \"Creeper,\" where a narrative of uneasy desire (\"I wanna touch you in a painted stall\") unfurls over a pulsing, fractured track that conveys several kinds of tension. In theory, balance and restraint aren't the most exciting virtues for an album to possess, but in practice, Liminal's subtlety is confident and dynamic.

        "summary": "Four albums into their career and it became clear to the Kooks it was time to shake things up. Their third record, 2011's Junk of the Heart, came dangerously close to the middle of the road -- it was excessively polished and reliant on measured pop tunes -- and didn't make anybody's pulse race, so the group decided to take a different tactic on 2014's Listen. Hooking up with Inflo, a British hip-hop producer who makes his big-time debut here, the Kooks definitively take a step toward a fresher, modern music, one that's informed by dance music and rap, not to mention a retro-new wave fetish that's simultaneously old and new. Classicists that they are, the Kooks don't necessarily sound futuristic as they expand their horizons; when they dabble in disco on \"Forgive & Forget\" they recall not only the future shock of 1980 but also Franz Ferdinand, the single \"Down\" dilutes and angelicizes Kid Rock's \"Batwatdibaba,\" while \"Westside\" and \"Are We Electric\" get slathered in synths straight out of 1982. These rhythmic tracks, which are a far cry from the caution of Junk of the Heart, are paired with limber guitar pop (\"It Was London,\" \"Bad Habit\") that is firmly within the quartet's wheelhouse. The more familiar sounds are paired with the sturdiest songwriting but what gathers attention here are the tracks furthest afield from the Kooks' traditional pop. Especially after the staid Junk, the deliberate liveliness of Listen is indeed welcome, and sometimes, the results come close to infectious. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Houndmouth have embraced the concept of \"loosely tight,\" delivering a rollicking fusion of boogie-fied retro-rock and folk-flavored Americana that's been carefully crafted to sound casual even though this band clearly worked out these songs with meticulous care. The \"loosely tight\" vibe served Houndmouth well on their first album, 2013's From the Hills Below the City, and they've swum even farther into the deep end with their sophomore effort, 2015's Little Neon Limelight. The performances on Little Neon Limelight sound and feel like they were captured live in the studio with a minimum of fuss, right down to the chatter that trails several tracks, and the group's four-part harmonies are easygoing but impressive. In addition, guitarist Matt Myers' sharp, concise riffs recall any number of '60s and '70s boogie masters (most notably Sam Andrew of Big Brother & the Holding Company), and Katie Toupin's keyboards add tasty accents and her occasional lead vocals are suitably soulful and emotionally expansive while still sounding low-key. But as good as Houndmouth are at sounding like an enthusiastic country-rock band from a bygone age of patchouli and bongwater, something about Little Neon Limelight doesn't quite ring true; the melodies are OK, but the lyrics seem clichÃ©d and formulaic, and as much as Houndmouth have done their homework, they're ultimately running on riffs and ideas that are the product of another age, and while they work these angles well, they're incapable of making the music sound entirely their own. Houndmouth feel a bit like a jam band that never gets around to playing an extended improvisation, which might feel like an advantage in theory, but turns out to be less of a virtue in execution as these players can't seem to get their boogie into fifth gear. Houndmouth have the right touch and impressive chops, but this album makes it clear they needs a songwriter who can make their music seem fresh even as it's modeled on the past. ~ Mark Deming",

        "summary": "Eric Clapton's new millennium has largely been defined by collaborations with friends, beginning with a duet album with B.B. King following through with a Cream reunion and closing with tours with his former Blind Faith running mate, Steve Winwood. Clapton and Winwood did three concerts together at Madison Square Garden in February 2008 and the results were fruitful enough to spawn this double-disc album -- along with its accompanying DVD set -- and a moderately scaled 2009 tour. Live from Madison Square Garden culls 21 highlights from those three nights and spreads them over two discs, sequencing the songs so Traffic numbers alternate with selections from Blind Faith, Derek & the Dominos, blues standards, a handful of Clapton's hits, and a heavy dose of Hendrix, who has no less than three songs here. That extended salute to Jimi is a good indication of the vibe here -- this is a genuine shared co-billing with Clapton and Winwood trading vocals and solos almost equally. There's not much ego here and not much hunger, either, with the two stars sliding into a relaxed groove that yields plenty of rewards. There's a comfortable touch to their playing that's greatly appealing, and the straightforward setting places the spotlight directly on their interplay. Clapton and Winwood might roll easy but they can still create some sparks, sometimes in unexpected places, such as the somewhat forgotten '80s hits \"Forever Man\" and \"Split Decision,\" both which are highlights here. Ultimately, this isn't an album of moments, but rather a sustained whole that finds Clapton and Winwood egging each other on to produce a wholly satisfying, if not quite surprising, reunion. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "After The Velvet Underground cut three albums for the jazz-oriented Verve label that earned them lots of notoriety but negligible sales, the group signed with industry powerhouse Atlantic Records in 1970; label head Ahmet Ertegun supposedly asked Lou Reed to avoid sex and drugs in his songs, and instead focus on making an album \"loaded with hits.\" Loaded was the result, and with appropriate irony it turned out to be the first VU album that made any noticeable impact on commercial radio -- and also their swan song, with Reed leaving the group shortly before its release. With John Cale long gone from the band, Doug Yule highly prominent (he sings lead on four of the ten tracks), and Maureen Tucker absent on maternity leave, this is hardly a purist's Velvet Underground album. But while Lou Reed always wrote great rock & roll songs with killer hooks, on Loaded his tunes were at last given a polished but intelligent production that made them sound like the hits they should have been, and there's no arguing that \"Sweet Jane\" and \"Rock and Roll\" are as joyously anthemic as anything he's ever recorded. And if this release generally maintains a tight focus on the sunny side of the VU's personality (or would that be Reed's personality?), \"New Age\" and \"Oh! Sweet Nuthin'\" prove he had hardly abandoned his contemplative side, and \"Train Around the Bend\" is a subtle but revealing metaphor for his weariness with the music business. Sterling Morrison once said of Loaded, \"It showed that we could have, all along, made truly commercial sounding records,\" but just as importantly, it proved they could do so without entirely abandoning their musical personality in the process. It's a pity that notion hadn't occurred to anyone a few years earlier. [Loaded was re-released on LP in 2015.] ~ Mark Deming",

        "summary": "The Long Road Home: In Concert is a double-CD companion piece to the live DVD of the same name released in the summer of 2006. Appearing a couple months after the DVD, the CD has the same tracks in the same sequencing as the DVD, capturing the September 15, 2005, concert at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles in its entirety. In either incarnation, this is one terrifically entertaining performance, a spirited stroll through Fogerty's back catalog inspired by his excellent 2005 compilation, The Long Road Home, which was the first collection to contain music from both his years as Creedence Clearwater Revival's leader and as a solo act. Although the original recordings, particularly the CCR sides, remain definitive, the concert in a way makes a stronger argument than the comp for the common threads within Fogerty's body of work, since the newer tunes sit side by side with the classics, all performed by his crackerjack band featuring guitarists Bob Britt and Billy Burnette. Here, recent songs like \"Hot Rod Heart,\" \"Rambunctious Boy,\" and \"DÃ©jÃ  Vu (All Over Again)\" fit comfortably alongside \"Green River,\" \"Lodi,\" \"Centerfield,\" \"Fortunate Son,\" and \"Proud Mary,\" among other Fogerty standards, because there is no difference in the sound of the recordings; it's just this terrific band playing, and the crisp and muscular performances illustrate that there's not a great difference between the rockabilly of \"Blue Moon Nights\" and \"Looking Out My Back Door.\" That small but important revelation is what makes The Long Road Home: In Concert, in either its video or audio incarnation, a cut above the average live album. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

By the time THE LONG RUN was released in early 1979, the laid-back West Coast rock scene that The Eagles had dominated throughout the decade had pretty much run its course.  Many of the biggest rock groups of the era -- including The Eagles--were incorporating new influences into their music and toughening up their sound.\r\n\r\nWhile similar in feel to HOTEL CALIFORNIA, THE LONG RUN is a far more diverse album that features an immaculately crafted set of songs ranging from the soulful pop of the Don Henley-sung title track and \"I Can' t Tell You Why\" to tough, country-influenced rocker \"Heartache Tonight\" and the epic, dynamic \"In The City.\"  Even though Don Henley, Glen Frey and Joe Walsh would all go on to lead successful solo careers in the ensuing years, they would rarely better the polished pop on THE LONG RUN.",

        "summary": "Take the title to Wayne Brady's full-length singing debut as bombastic -- as in \"the great Wayne Brady will finally grace us with song\" -- and you're missing the point and more importantly, the charm. One listen and A Long Time Coming instantly feels like a reference to Brady's enthusiasm over living the dream, recording R&B that's influenced by Babyface and Luther Vandross, plus a bit of what came before with a touch of adult contemporary. This is grown folks music with a demographic that matches daytime television's but it's hardly contrived. In the case of \"Can't Buy Me Love,\" it's quite inspired with Brady turning the Beatles' chestnut into a slow jam ballad, one perfect for whatever \"Pillow Talk\" show the local R&B station airs on weeknights. High-top fade and moms who wouldn't let you get Jheri curls are the sweet memories that fill \"Back in the Day,\" a giddy highlight that doesn't blush when gushing over Thundercats, friendship bracelets, and \"Members Only/Kid 'N Play/That's how we did back in the day.\" Just as good and even more old-school is \"I Ain't Movin,\" a finger-snapping mod-soul song featuring authentic farfisa organ and tambourine. With an orchestra behind him, Brady does just fine when walking on hallowed ground and delivering \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" in way that's both respectful and obviously enamored with Sam Cooke's performance. \"F.W.B.\" stands for \"Friends with Benefits\" giving the album its raciest moment, with \"Ordinary\" and the previously mentioned \"I Ain't Movin'\" both singing the praises of long-term monogamy. Going where Usher won't, the wholesome \"All Naturally\" gets sugary about that \"just woke up\" look with \"You don't have to wear lipstick/To make me wanna come taste your kisses/You don't have to get your hair did/To make me wanna run my fingers through it.\" It's that \"hair did\" line that Celine would never deliver -- at least not as sincerely -- that reminds listeners there's been a gap in adult music since Luther left and Anita Baker became underproductive. With a George Duke guest performance, gorgeously polished production from the Heavyweights team, plus plenty of heart-on-the-sleeve lyrics, Brady helps fill that gap, giving the R&B-loving Mom and Dad their next great date night album. ~ David Jeffries",

An ominous, bombastic feel runs through much of the score, particularly on pieces like \"A Journey in the Dark,\" \"Flight to the Ford,\" and \"A Knife in the Dark,\" but Shore also includes respites such as the sweetly elfin, Celtic-tinged \"Concerning Hobbits\" and the stately \"Many Meetings.\" The vibrant \"Bridge of Khazad Dum\" and \"Amon Hen\" combine the score's major themes into dazzling climaxes, while Enya's contributions, \"Council of Elrond\" and \"May It Be,\" add a subtle serenity that gives the score balance. While it's not a particularly melodic score, Lord of the Rings nevertheless does an excellent job of conveying the film's moods through music and has more than enough presence to be appreciated outside of the film's context. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "When Philadelphia-based purveyors of stripped-down, haunted rock perfection the War on Drugs came on the scene with their 2008 debut, Wagonwheel Blues, their sound perked up the ears of a new generation of soul searchers looking for a soundtrack. Summoning up the patron saints of FM radio rock, the band was constantly framed as an update to the wild-eyed sermons of Dylan and Springsteen or the summer-night abandon that Tom Petty perfected, all filtered through walls of decidedly indie guitar noise. Founding member Kurt Vile left the band to pursue his blooming solo path by the time of 2011's Slave Ambient, leaving key songwriter Adam Granduciel running the show completely for that album's well-received set of songs and heightened production. Work on follow-up third album Lost in the Dream began while the band was on tour in 2012, with the full process of writing, demoing, and recording stretching out over a 15-month period and employing five different studios in as many states. Instead of resulting in a piecemeal pastiche of discordant ideas, Lost in the Dream actually represents the most fully realized statement from the group thus far, with all ten songs gelling together with a sense of purpose and understated brilliance the band came close to before, but delivers in full here. Starting with the epic two-chord gallop of \"Under the Pressure,\" Granduciel offers up song after song of incredibly restrained yet entirely engaged rock. The classic rock reference points led to a \"blue-collar rock\" labeling of the band's sound, and while there are undeniable callbacks to Petty, Dylan, and Springsteen here, as there were on earlier albums, the War on Drugs have come into their own with their sound. What comes on as simplistic or even predictable rock instrumentation always unfolds to reveal buried synth sounds, horn blurts, long ambient passages, and -- more impressively -- an unexpected emotional depth propping up the bare-bones songs. While \"Burning\" channels the same yelping frustration and working-class trudge of Springsteen's \"Dancing in the Dark,\" songs like \"Red Eyes\" and the gorgeous \"An Ocean in Between the Waves\" meld Jackson Browne's inward-looking sensitivity and Fleetwood Mac-like mysteriousness with an edgy depravity belonging to Granduciel alone. The songs are expansive, regardless of their tone, with the ten tunes sprawling out into almost an hourlong running time, leaving no stone unturned in their nuanced production and deceptively simple presentation. In this way, Lost in the Dream is the War on Drugs' Daydream Nation or Disintegration; lengthy distillations of similar themes result in wildly different threads of song, all connecting again in the end. It's a near flawless collection of dreamy vibes, shifting moods, and movement, and stands easily as Granduciel's finest hour so far. [Also released on LP.] ~ Fred Thomas",

He had played with Dylan during the Rolling Thunder Revue of 1975 and 1976 -- a tour that happened to occur in the wake of the first official release of The Basement Tapes -- but more importantly, his 2002 work on the Grammy-winning O Brother Where Art Thou? soundtrack established him as deft modernizer of classic American folk and country, skills that were needed for an album that wound up called Lost on the River. Burnett decided to assemble a loose-knit band of Americana superstars to write the music and play as a band. That's how Burnett's old pal Elvis Costello, Jim James of My Morning Jacket, Taylor Goldsmith of Dawes, Marcus Mumford of Mumford & Sons, and Rhiannon Giddens of the Carolina Chocolate Drops became a band called the New Basement Tapes (the name seems more of a formality than an actual moniker), and if Burnett's intent was to approximate the communal spirit Dylan had with the Band at Big Pink, the execution was much different. The New Basement Tapes recorded Lost on the River in a real studio fully aware there was an audience awaiting their output, an attitude that's the polar opposite of the ramshackle joshing around of the original Basement Tapes. Thankfully, nobody involved with Lost on the River contrives to replicate either the sound or feel of the 1967 sessions, even if the artists consciously pick up the strands of country, folk, and soul dangling on the originals. Wisely, the songwriters steer their given lyrics toward their own wheelhouses, which means this contains a little of the woolliness of a collective but Burnett sands off the rough edges, tying this all together. Certainly, some musicians make their presence known more than others -- there's a slow, soulful ease to James' four contributions that stand in nice contrast to Costello's canny bluster (\"Married to My Hack\" would've fit onto any EC album featuring Marc Ribot) -- but the best work might come from Goldsmith, who strikes a delicate, beguiling balance between his own idiosyncrasies and the Americana currents that flow out of The Basement Tapes. Then again, the whole project is rather impressive: Burnett and the New Basement Tapes remain faithful to the spirit of The Basement Tapes yet take enough liberties to achieve their own identity, which is a difficult trick to achieve. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Love Is Simple is the sound of Akron/Family truly finding their feet as a band, and then stretching their limbs out as far as possible in many directions. A concept album only in the loosest sense, with its basic rubric concerning the core concepts of love of natural beauty, Love Is Simple is mostly riveting and only occasionally trying. For a band that already defies easy categorization, their fourth album is particularly all over the map; as the music races through vastly disparate styles, it veers between sounding whimsically profound and maddeningly fleeting. Despite its sheer charm, the constant shifts in mood assure that one will never be able to lose themselves completely to the album -- the joy is more in just watching it unfold. As the enigmatic Akron cult/band continues to expand its attention-deficit approach to eliminating easy classification, they end up moving even farther beyond the obvious \"freak-folk\" and \"psychedelic\" tags into all sorts of world music, classic rock, and post-rock. Perhaps the easiest way to understand this music, however, is to simply call it \"indie rock,\" since an emerging trend with so many like-minded groups such as Animal Collective, Battles, and Deerhoof, is to forge similar paths into fractured indefinability. There's certainly enough neo-hippie guitar noodling and singalong chants to carry this material well into jam band territory, if it weren't for the precise structures and catchy melodicism which abound throughout. Akron/Family is one of those bands which make sense of an oxymoron like \"planned improvisation.\" Coming after the subdued opening track, \"Ed Is a Portal\" is perhaps the prototypical track here, with its droning guitar line, tribal beat, and chanted, nonsensical lyrics dissolving into a beautiful Led Zeppelin-style acoustic break before everything slowly rebuilds again, only to end with a minute-long trip-hop excursion which feels like a completely new song. Indeed, it's difficult to think in terms of whole songs here rather than segments of songs -- even the track breaks start seeming arbitrary after awhile. The two extended tracks in the middle of the album, \"Lake Song/New Ceremonial Music for Moms\" and \"There's So Many Colors\" act as the centerpieces, and contain both the best and worst elements of Akron/Family's sound. The former contains a majestically subtle interplay between bells, acoustic guitar, light percussion, and vocal harmonies which adds a beautifully placed flamenco-esque guitar solo for maximum effect, but as the track shifts focus, it becomes increasingly grating, until the last three minutes are little more than meandering screams and noise. Immediately following that are the two minutes of chanted group singing that open \"There's So Many Colors,\" which can make for a tough patch to get through -- that is, until a guitar starts playing a riff which quickly morphs from sounding like King Crimson to Spacemen 3 to Phish, bringing the song finally into a bluesy romp which becomes a definite winner. The latter half of Love Is Simple creates a more blissfully reflective mood all in all, with briefer, more self-contained songs such as \"Pony's O.G.\" and \"Crickets,\" which are a real pleasure, if not quite as memorable. Earlier, on \"I've Got Some Friends,\" Akron/Family sings \"That's how it should be/that's how it is.\" That outlook permeates through all the songs here -- the band will take any sound or aesthetic they feel like, and incorporate it into the grand scheme of things, no matter how unlikely the combination. Most often, this approach works wonders in creating a fascinating auditory journey which is satisfying on multiple levels. ~ Ben Peterson",

        "summary": "Inevitably, certain jazz titles will be reissued over and over. Miles Davis' seminal Kind of Blue has been reissued many times, and you can safely assume that A Love Supreme will continue to be a decent seller (by jazz standards) as long as it keeps getting reissued. What separates this deluxe 2002 reissue of the John Coltrane classic from all of the previous versions that have come out over the years? For one thing, this version is a two-CD set; the previous versions were either single CDs or single LPs. While disc one offers the digitally remastered (again) contents of the original A Love Supreme, disc two is devoted to previously unreleased material -- all of which is aimed at serious collectors. Part of disc two focuses on a July 26, 1965, appearance at the Antibes Jazz Festival in France, where Coltrane, pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Jimmy Garrison, and drummer Elvin Jones perform A Love Supreme's four-piece suite in its entirety. The quartet favors an inside/outside approach, and their live performances of \"Acknowledgment,\" \"Resolution,\" \"Pursuance,\" and \"Psalm\" are more accessible than the atonal free jazz that Coltrane provided in 1966 and 1967. The rest of disc two is devoted to studio material from December 1964, including alternate takes of \"Resolution\" and \"Acknowledgment.\" Collectors will be thrilled to learn that the two \"Acknowledgment\" outtakes find tenor saxman Archie Shepp and bassist Art Davis joining Coltrane's quartet; neither Shepp nor Davis are present on any of the previous A Love Supreme reissues. Casual listeners are advised to pass on this double CD and stick to a single-CD version of A Love Supreme -- this two-disc set is strictly for collectors and hardcore fans, and those who fit that description will no doubt find it to be fascinating. ~ Alex Henderson",

        "summary": "\"Gentle\" and \"reassuring\" aren't necessarily the most exciting compliments to give an album, but Mutual Benefit's Jordan Lee turns those virtues into a remarkably engaging full-length debut. Inspired by the struggles some of his friends were enduring, on Love's Crushing Diamond Lee builds on the winsome, folky indie he began crafting with a series of EPs on Bandcamp and his own Kassette Klub label. The comparisons to early-2000s indie folk luminaries like Sufjan, Animal Collective, and Antlers still stand, and the mix of rustic sounds and wide-ranging atmospheres also recalls Yellow House-era Grizzly Bear or Mercury Rev circa Deserter's Songs, particularly on tracks like \"That Light That's Blinding,\" where dappled banjos and strings mingle with sweet vocal harmonies that rise and fall like breathing. Yet Mutual Benefit often sounds more down-to-earth than many of those acts on Love's Crushing Diamond. Lee harnesses the found sounds that peppered his earlier work into subtle embellishments that give these songs a greater depth, as on \"Strong River,\" which opens the album with wind chimes and strings that tremble with anticipation, or a sense of whimsy, as on the vignette \"Let's Play.\" The waver in Lee's voice when he sings \"We weren't meant to be this way/We weren't meant to be afraid\" on \"Advanced Falconry\" never feels affected, and though he claims to be inarticulate while seeing his loved ones suffer, lyrics like \"To say goodbye makes a mess of all my thoughts/Makes me wish for eloquence/When it's love that's all I've got\" from \"Statue of a Man\" suggest otherwise. In its own poetic way, Love's Crushing Diamond is a title that captures the hope and hardship in these songs, and the album's kindness and calmness make it the musical embodiment of a friend whose shoulder is ready to cry on at a moment's notice. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "Following through with the avant-garde inclinations of Station to Station, yet explicitly breaking with David Bowie's past, Low is a dense, challenging album that confirmed his place at rock's cutting edge. Driven by dissonant synthesizers and electronics, Low is divided between brief, angular songs and atmospheric instrumentals. Throughout the record's first half, the guitars are jagged and the synthesizers drone with a menacing robotic pulse, while Bowie's vocals are unnaturally layered and overdubbed. During the instrumental half, the electronics turn cool, which is a relief after the intensity of the preceding avant pop. Half the credit for Low's success goes to Brian Eno, who explored similar ambient territory on his own releases. Eno functioned as a conduit for Bowie's ideas, and in turn Bowie made the experimentalism of not only Eno but of the German synth group Kraftwerk and the post-punk group Wire respectable, if not quite mainstream. Though a handful of the vocal pieces on Low are accessible -- \"Sound and Vision\" has a shimmering guitar hook, and \"Be My Wife\" subverts soul structure in a surprisingly catchy fashion -- the record is defiantly experimental and dense with detail, providing a new direction for the avant-garde in rock & roll. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Lukas Graham -- the funky Danish band named after its charismatic frontman -- released their sophomore self-titled album in their home country in 2015. It went on to become a hit, spending nearly 20 weeks atop the Danish album charts and spawning the international hit, \"7 Years.\" In 2016, Lukas Graham released that breakthrough -- nicknamed the Blue Album -- in the United States, just as \"7 Years\" climbed toward the top of the Billboard charts. Packed with jovial doses of soulful pop/rock that recalled the catchiest of Ed Sheeran and Maroon 5, Lukas Graham also sprinkled in Ronson-esque throwback flourishes atop the classic songcraft of Billy Joel. The album's popularity derives in part to its relatability and its frontman's passion and charm. Graham's lyrics are reflective and straightforward. He's a storyteller, providing accessible snapshots of his life embellished with upbeat and soulful backing by the band, whether it's lighthearted fare like falling for a stripper on \"Strip No More\" or the cautionary bro-tale \"Hayo.\" One of his best narratives, the aforementioned \"7 Years,\" channels Graham's grief after the passing of his father in 2012 -- the same year the group began its ascent on the back of its eponymous debut -- wringing a lifetime of lessons out of four wistful minutes. His parents loom large over other tracks, like the \"Hard Knock Life\" ode to his Christiania upbringing on \"Mama Said\" and the evocative \"Happy Home.\" Although the most emotional songs could inspire tears, they somehow provide solace and end up feeling uplifting: even on the raise-your-pint closing track, \"Funeral,\" they manage to transform a typically somber event into a cause for celebration. \"Everyone I know better be wasted...Cause the way I lived, it was amazing.\" The unpretentious nature of the music and Graham's laid-back attitude give each song an everyman quality, presented by a youthful, wide-eyed raconteur who has just enough life experience to speak to a wide audience. On Lukas Graham, listeners are invited to party with Graham and his boys, knocking back a few drinks, talking about life, and hugging it all out with a smile. ~ Neil Z. Yeung",

        "summary": "The duo of Mike Stroud and Evan Mast have stayed remarkably true to the sound they developed on Ratatat's first album, 2004's self-titled affair. Though there have been slight stylistic diversions on the albums that followed, especially on 2008's LP3, their core of neatly wound, double-tracked guitar melodies, thrumming basslines, and tight beats has remained intact. Though it was released five years after its predecessor LP4, a gap that might lead one to think that big changes were brewing, 2015's Magnifique delivers everything fans might expect from a Ratatat album. Stripping away much of the excess instrumentation and frills that adorned the previous two albums, Magnifique mostly sticks to the basics on the way to becoming the duo's most brightly immediate record yet, bouncing between sunny, hook-heavy uptempo tracks that have the kind of manic energy that could lead people to tear off their shirts and seriously lose it on the dancefloor and relaxed, soft rock-inspired songs that serve as a nice soundtrack when one is coming down from those kinds of highs. Almost any song could be lifted from the album for their greatest-hits collection, like the super-catchy \"Cream on Chrome\" or the driving \"Abrasive.\" Along with all the trademark Ratatat moments, along the way a couple songs deviate from the norm in pleasing ways, like the Santo & Johnny-styled Hawaiian ballad \"Drift\" that drifts along during the middle section of the album like a soft warm breeze, or the swaying cover of Springwater's 1971 song \"I Will Return,\" which features the guys' first ever vocals. The epic-length dancefloor jam \"Nightclub Amnesia\" stretches out their usually concise tunes into something expansive and pretty brilliant, easily giving Daft Punk's most recent efforts a run for their money. Throughout the album, the duo's blend of instrumentation proves masterful once again. Every instrument is locked tightly in place exactly where it should be and the little tricks they drop in here and there to keep things interesting work just the way they intended. Magnifique doesn't show a ton of artistic growth or progression; it's more of a rebranding that tightly focuses on their strengths and passes them to the consumer like a sharp, swift punch to the brain and feet. ~ Tim Sendra",

        "summary": "Stepping out from behind the piano/drums of Melbourne indie pop three-piece the Basics for the third time, Belgian-Australian multi-instrumentalist Wally De Backer, aka Gotye's first solo record in five years, Making Mirrors, reveals a love of the '80s pop scene, which extends far beyond the usual influences of the current nu-synth brigade. The hugely experimental follow-up to 2006's Like Drawing Blood doesn't discriminate against other decades, as evident on the impossibly uplifting '60s retro soul of \"I Feel Better,\" the '70s West Coast harmonies of the ethereal lullaby-like closer \"Bronte,\" the '90s Beck-esque scuzzy garage rock of \"Easy Way Out,\" and the 2000s hushed, claustrophobic dubstep of \"Don't Worry, We'll Be Watching You.\" But seemingly unaffected by the constant comparisons with the likes of Sting and Peter Gabriel, it's the era of early new wave, dub, and worldbeat which defines its 12 tracks. Unexpected chart-topper \"Somebody That I Used to Know,\" a collaboration with New Zealand vocalist Kimbra, is an oddball break-up song whose stuttering rhythms, reggae hooks, and hushed vocals sound like the Police as remixed by the XX, \"Smoke and Mirrors\" echoes the avant-garde pop of Gabriel's So, with its pounding tribal drums, orchestral flourishes, and new age melodies, while there are also nods to George Michael's \"Faith\" on the acoustic gospel-pop of \"In Your Light\"; the impassioned Aussie rock of Midnight Oil on the ecologically themed \"Eyes Wide Open,\" and electro pioneer Thomas Dolby on the strange, vocodered vocals, spoken word samples, and skank guitars of the trippy \"State of the Art.\" Familiar they may be, but some credit has to go to De Backer for managing to weave these eclectic retro sounds into a cohesive affair, which proves that along with recent efforts by Art vs. Science and Architecture in Helsinki, Australia is fast becoming one of the biggest purveyors of quality experimental pop. ~ Jon O'Brien",

Naturally, this means that Mark Knopfler's ambitions as a songwriter are growing, as the storytelling pretensions of Making Movies indicate. Fortunately, his skills are increasing, as the lovely \"Romeo and Juliet,\" \"Tunnel of Love,\" and \"Skateaway\" indicate. And Making Movies is helped by a new wave-tinged pop production, which actually helps Knopfler's jazzy inclinations take hold. The record runs out of steam toward the end, closing with the borderline offensive \"Les Boys,\" but the remainder of Making Movies ranks among the band's finest work. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Even though it contained no hits, The Man Who Sold the World, for most intents and purposes, was the beginning of David Bowie's classic period. Working with guitarist Mick Ronson and producer Tony Visconti for the first time, Bowie developed a tight, twisted heavy guitar rock that appears simple on the surface but sounds more gnarled upon each listen. The mix is off-center, with the fuzz-bass dominating the compressed, razor-thin guitars and Bowie's strangled, affected voice. The sound of The Man Who Sold the World is odd, but the music itself is bizarre, with Bowie's weird, paranoid futuristic tales melded to Ronson's riffing and the band's relentless attack. Musically, there isn't much innovation on The Man Who Sold the World -- it is almost all hard blues-rock or psychedelic folk-rock -- but there's an unsettling edge to the band's performance, which makes the record one of Bowie's best albums. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "As rock music moved forward in new and unexpected directions in the latter part of the '60s, no band merged the virtues of past and present as well as Creedence Clearwater Revival. The group clearly drew from the classic sounds of blues, R&B, rockabilly, and swamp rock, but they played with an energy and imagination that was entirely up to date, and they were one of the few bands who could dive into an extended jam on occasion while still understanding the beauty of the three-minute single. And the group's leader, John Fogerty, was one of the finest American songwriters to emerge in the second half of the '60s, building on classic American archetypes while expressing the rage and tumult of his times. Between 1968 and 1972, the prolific group released seven studio albums, and The 40th Anniversary Editions Box Set features all of them, presented complete and with bonus tracks, documenting the full arc of Creedence Clearwater Revival's remarkable career. Albums included are Creedence Clearwater Revival (1968), Bayou Country (1969), Green River (1969), Willy and the Poor Boys (1969), Cosmo's Factory (1970), Pendulum (1970), and Mardi Gras (1972). ~ Mark Deming",

        "summary": "Field Report shrunk from seven musicians to four within a year of their eponymous debut album's release, but while listening to their second full-length, 2014's Marigolden, much of the time it doesn't seem that there are even that many people on hand. Marigolden's sound is purposefully spare and uncluttered, and one imagines the group's leader and songwriter, Christopher Porterfield, could have worked up many of these tracks by his lonesome if he'd been so inclined (and \"Ambrosia\" is indeed just Porterfield and his piano). While Porterfield's bandmates certainly help invite some striking atmospheres (especially Ben Lester on pedal steel and guitar and multi-instrumentalist Shane Leonard), and Robbie Lackritz's production finds a satisfying middle ground between cool, electronic surfaces and the more organic tones of acoustic instruments and percussion, ultimately this is Porterfield's show, guided by the understated force of his vocals and the evocative intelligence of his lyrical imagery, and it's impressive work. Marigolden is the sound of a world of endless prairies and snowy flatlands where a handful of characters ponder the loves they're left in transit, the peaks and valleys of the drinker's life, and a loneliness that seems at once like poison and a balm. Some albums are about mood more than anything else, and on Marigolden Porterfield shows he's a master of creating an ambience that's cinematic in its strength and emotional impact. If anything, the relative minimalism of Marigolden brings out the strengths of Porterfield's songs and the group's sagacious approach to arrangements and the studio; while it might be counterproductive if Field Report were to shrink past a quartet, the streamlined approach of Marigolden is a superb example of how less can truly be more. ~ Mark Deming",

        "summary": "Following his group sojourns with major-label projects Home Town Hero (on Maverick) and Under the Influence of Giants (on Island), Aaron Bruno resurfaces as a one-man band (albeit with a lot of help, including longtime partner Drew Stewart) under the name AWOLNATION on Megalithic Symphony. A megalith is a large stone, so a megalithic symphony would seem to be an ambitious suite of rock music, and the album fits its title if one interprets the ambition as an unfettered eclecticism and sense of whimsy, as tethered to constant dance beats. Bruno seems to have built his tracks up from the percussion patterns, and once he got the beats he liked, he layered poppy melodies supporting lyrics sung in falsetto or a gritty tenor, with plenty of goofy electronic sounds in between. The \"anything goes\" quality takes in a spoken-word track (\"Some Sort of Creature\") and songs that recall everything from Prince to Men Without Hats. It all comes together on the 15-minute closer, \"Knights of Shame,\" which begins with Bruno imploring, \"Dance, baby, like the world is ending,\" and continues through various sections including a rap by Cameron Duddy, and ends, after a minute or so of silence, with a hidden track that finds Bruno strumming his acoustic guitar and croaking, \"It's been a long time waiting for you.\" Megalithic Symphony engages the ear from moment to moment and allows Aaron Bruno to try out a variety of ideas, many of them half-baked, but all of them entertaining. [A Deluxe Edition added a second disc of remixed and live tracks.] ~ William Ruhlmann",

        "summary": "This five-track EP may be a bald-faced stopgap release, designed to keep the fans happy while work continues on the next album, but it's a remarkably well-thought-out stopgap effort and a very attractive one. It opens with the title track, which is taken from the Faking the Books album and very nicely juxtaposes organic guitar sounds with a claustrophobic drum loop and sweetly melodic but rather laconic vocals. This track is then followed by a remixed version by Boom Bip, a fairly radical reworking of the material that almost wholly eliminates the singing while deconstructing the music itself into a glitchy, statical cloud of rhythm. \"Daily Match\" and \"Harrison Reverse\" both seem to be outtakes from the Faking the Books sessions, and although it's hard to see why the former wasn't chosen for inclusion, the latter does come across as an attractive and promising sketch rather than a fully formed song. The Alias remix of \"Alienation,\" another Faking the Books album track, starts off delicately funky and then gradually picks up mass and momentum as it proceeds. Very satisfying overall. ~ Rick Anderson",

        "summary": "To get the formalities out of the way, Miike Snow is not a singer/songwriter named Mike. Miike Snow isn't even a he, actually. It's an indie-electro pop trio, made up of singer Andrew Wyatt of Fires of Rome and Swedish (hence the double \"i\" in the name) mega producers Chris Karlsson and Pontus Winnberg, otherwise known as Bloodshy & Avant. Those familiar with Bloodshy & Avant's track record -- working with Britney Spears, Madonna, and Kylie Minogue -- will know that they're capable of making top-notch pop gloss geared for the dancefloor. But the question here is, \"can they create music that isn't designed for club-goers and teeny boppers?\" With their self-titled release, they do make light, inoffensive pop with twinkling synths and unshakable choruses, but it's a pretty substantial shift in style from their past gigs. Consistent throughout, the album's more suited for a coffee shop or a Sunday morning drive than a night out with the girls, with its fill of slick mid-tempo beats and Swedish twee glee. Starting with a hook that doesn't sound too far off from a Vampire Weekend cut (not a surprising reference point, since Miike Snow's repertoire of remixes includes a version of \"The Kids Don't Stand a Chance\"), dubby synths circulate around flighty vocals with heavy sentiments: \"I change shapes just to hide in this place, but I'm still, I'm still an animal.\" Slight of hand seems to be one of the group's best tricks, as they take lyrics with moody undertones to unexpectedly joyous heights. When the second track, \"Burial\" -- a slice of pop that's as instantly accessible as the first -- starts with the line, \"Misery is all we know lately,\" the music box keyboards never hint at anything but a sweet little ditty. Production tricks are used just enough to keep the sound fresh as Karlsson and Winnberg rifle through their folders of synth sounds and plug-ins, all the while adding arpeggiated bleeps, Moog pads, and the occasional octave effect to enhance vocal parts. As talented as they are, they could have easily gone overboard with the studio wizardry, but they show enough restraint to never break the illusion that this is a simple, easy listening, electro-pop record. There's no lack of artists making similar sounding music -- MGMT, Pop Levi, White Williams, and even Animal Collective come to mind -- but Miike Snow is ambitious and fun enough that they're worth checking out. ~ Jason Lymangrover",

        "summary": "The sessions for 1980's Double Fantasy were supposed to yield two albums, the second to be released at a future time, but Lennon's assassination tragically halted the project in its tracks. A bit over three years later, Yoko Ono issued tapes of many of the songs planned for that album under the title Milk and Honey, laid out in the same John-Yoko-John-Yoko dialogue fashion as its predecessor. Not unexpectedly, it's a rougher, less polished product, lacking the finishing touches and additional takes that Lennon most likely would have called for. Nevertheless, Lennon's songs at this point in their development were often quite strong, tougher than those on Double Fantasy in general, and the ad libs and studio chatter that might not have made the final cut give listeners more of a glimpse of Lennon's delightfully quirky personality. \"Nobody Told Me,\" the advance single off the album, is a rollicking, quizzical piece of work, maybe the best thing to come out of John's 1980 sessions, despite the unfinished-sounding transition to the chorus. \"Borrowed Time,\" another single, is a thoughtful, sparely worded meditation on growing older attached to a Caribbean beat. Yoko's contributions, while not as strong as John's, are surprisingly listenable -- the reggae-based \"Don't Be Scared,\" in particular -- and more current in texture, and her lyrics do tend to answer John's songs. As the album comes toward the close, the tone turns sentimental, culminating with one of John's loveliest tunes, \"Grow Old with Me,\" as presented on a home-recorded cassette in lieu of a studio recording. The ironies of this song and some of the other Lennon material are obviously poignant in the light of the cruel events of December 8, 1980; that and the fact that these songs haven't been as exposed as much as those on Double Fantasy lead some to prefer this sequel. ~ Richard S. Ginell",

        "summary": "London-based singer/songwriter Lyla Foy first emerged in late 2012 working under the alias WALL. The project came about on a lark, with the inspired Foy calling off plans with friends to instead work on music by herself at home. She came up with the first of what would be several incredibly well-received tracks that would be spread around the Internet over many months, ultimately culminating in her dropping the WALL moniker in favor of her given name, and signing to the Sub Pop label for debut album Mirrors the Sky. Foy's intimate, dark vocals glide easily oven ten songs' worth of spare instrumentation, ranging from the snappy indie electro of \"I Only\" to more organic, nearly country themes on \"Rumour.\" Foy's songs feel incredibly focused and close, as if she's singing in the same room with the listener even when the album lifts into soaring harmonies or booming electronic beats. Many of Foy's contemporaries can be heard in her songs, such as the moody Bat for Lashes rhythms and Kate Bush reappropriations of \"Easy\" and the numb loneliness in her voice that she shares with Lana Del Rey. \"No Secrets,\" the first track Foy recorded as WALL on that fateful night in 2012, resurfaces here, but ironically it's one of the weaker songs on the album. She finds her voice more surefootedly and satisfyingly on the slinky electro groove of \"Feather Tongue\" and Fleetwood Mac-recalling whispery pop of \"Impossible\" than on her more traditionally minded tunes. This strong debut points to even stronger, more focused work from Foy down the line. ~ Fred Thomas",

        "summary": "At the time of its release, Modern Vampires of the City was touted as a \"deeper\" offering from Vampire Weekend. While that's true to an extent, it downplays the equally heartfelt and clever songs on their first two albums. What is undeniable is that Modern Vampires is a lot less obviously showy than the band's previous work. They trade in Contra's bright eclecticism for a less audacious production style and smaller instrumental palette: guitar, organ, harpsichord, and the occasional sample combine into a rarefied sound that suggests a more introspective version of their debut, and the band bookends the album with some of its most literal and insular chamber pop on \"Obvious Bicycle\" and \"Young Lion.\" Modern Vampires' quieter approach also showcases what might be most enduring about Vampire Weekend's music -- endearing melodies and carefully crafted lyrics. It also fits Ezra Koenig's preoccupations on this set of songs, chief among them the fact that we're all going to die. The band sums up all of this brilliantly on \"Step,\" where the music's hip-hop beats and harpsichords reflect the allusions to Souls of Mischief and growing pains in Koenig's lyrics. Elsewhere, Vampire Weekend tones down the quirks that may have polarized listeners before; songs like \"Everlasting Arms\" and  \"Unbelievers\" walk the fine line between cheery and grating so well that they could win over those who previously found them too peppy and preppy. Similarly, Modern Vampires of the City's political allusions are also subtler than they were on Contra, where the band brandished them like college students all too willing to display their awareness of current events: Koenig sounds offhanded when he sings \"though we live on the US dollar/We got our own sense of time\" on \"Hannah Hunt,\" and even the album's most overtly political song, the darkly verbose \"Hudson,\" adopts a more historical stance as it incorporates everything from 17th century explorers, pre-war apartments, and exclusive New York neighborhoods into its meditations on fate versus free will. Of course, Vampire Weekend can't completely stifle their exuberance, and the album's louder moments stand out even more vibrantly against the subdued ones. \"Diane Young\"'s brash, buzzy mix of doo wop, surf, and punk feels like a nod to Contra as well as Billy Joel's \"You May Be Right,\" and Koenig sings \"I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die\" with so much joy on \"Finger Back\" that it celebrates life as much as it contemplates mortality. Ultimately, Modern Vampires of the City is more thoughtful than it is dark, balancing its more serious moments with a lighter touch and more confidence than they've shown before. Even if Koenig and company fear getting old, maturity suits them well. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "Hip-hop artists with commercial aspirations need never appear pandering to their audience, since a tough, defiant stance -- aka keeping it real -- is exactly what will draw in most crossover listeners anyway. Nevertheless, the Black Eyed Peas quickly embraced the pop world after the surprising success of third album Elephunk, and only continued their repositioning as a mainstream act with 2005's Monkey Business. That focus is immediately clear on the opener, \"Pump It Up,\" where they gladly welcome listeners on a track whose sample -- Dick Dale's \"Misirlou,\" already ubiquitous before it appeared in Pulp Fiction -- has to replace \"Walk This Way\" or \"I'll Be Missing You\" (more on Sting later) as the most conspicuous case of an unmissable rock riff being used on a rap track. With the Wal-Mart audience safely in tow, the group moves on to motivate its hip-hop base by reaching for every trick in the grab bag of contemporary urban music. These attempts are either serviceable or wildly unsuccessful. \"Disco Club\" is one of the few serviceable tracks, an apt re-creation of Cassidy's \"Hotel.\" Wildly unsuccessful is the group's utilization of its newest member, Fergie, to function as an imitator of the hyper-sexual Kelis/Ciara archetype on \"My Humps,\" which makes for one of the most embarrassing rap performances of the new millennium (sample lyric: \"My hump (9x)/My lovely little lumps\"). Unlike Elephunk, the Justin Timberlake feature here (\"My Style\") is placed early in the program, and it's bolstered by a Timbaland production, which eases the strain of an otherwise featherweight jam. Most of the songs on Monkey Business are the same type of party rap singalong that Black Eyed Peas made their name with on Elephunk. But other than \"Disco Club,\" the only one that works as anything but background party music is \"Feel It,\" a rare production by the group's apl.de.ap (will.i.am handles most of the rest). At the very tail end of the disc, there's one brief glance at Black Eyed Peas' history as a socially conscious group -- \"Union,\" featuring Sting and Branford Marsalis, which floats the usual bromides about peace and equality (and swipes the sound and speak of Bob Marley in the process). Monkey Business could easily sell just as well, or better, than Elephunk, but what the group made sound effortless in the past sounds strained and canned here.

        "summary": "Florida/California-rooted experimental pop collective Hundred Waters introduced the world to their impressive pastiche of electronic and organic sounds with their self-titled 2012 debut. Wild samples, cold beats, and effervescent walls of vocals drew comparisons to everyone from BjÃ¶rk to Dirty Projectors, though no comparisons were bold enough to really pin down the band's frenetic sound. In the two years that followed, Hundred Waters found themselves performing live a great deal more than in their beginnings, and approached the writing/recording process for sophomore album The Moon Rang Like a Bell with live performance in mind, hoping to dutifully replicate the sounds of the album in a live setting. Rather than turning in a stripped-down skeleton of their previous sound, the album is brimming with sound, clearer and more direct rather than particularly more spare or even organized all that differently than before. Still crouching in a coy posture at the forefront of all the songs are frontwoman Nicole Miglis' vocals, contorting into different breathy forms depending on the song. For instance, the incredibly constructed \"Out Alee\" finds her vocals weaving between bubbly ethereal samples and rolling basslines, sounding either like a female James Blake or a distant cousin of Bat for Lashes' Natasha Khan, depending on the movement. Throughout the album there are understated moments of mismatched sonics that somehow mesh perfectly. Ambulance and police sirens are buried in the mix of the dark, Christmas-like piano-and-bells dirge \"Murmurs,\" while wobbly ancient tape sounds, dark jittery beats, and songs built on micro-samples of music boxes and glacial bell sounds bring to mind everyone from Sigur RÃ³s to Aphex Twin to Burial without really sounding anything like any of these possible reference points. All of Hundred Waters' various unlikely combinations of sound come to a head on the jumpy beat and spinning wheel of mishmashed electronics of \"[Animal].\" The song teeters fearlessly between moments of cold, reserved balladry and nervous, sample-happy programming more in line with avant dance experiments by Laurie Anderson or Arthur Russell than any of the band's indie contemporaries. The album is endlessly engaging, offering a look inside the band's collective head as a carefree playground of sounds where dour string sections melt into watery piano loops, driving electronic drum samples, and spirals of angelic vocals without missing a beat. Though best taken as a whole spectrum of sonic possibilities, every song offers a different set of highlights, from the wide-eyed pop of \"Xtalk\" to the dark looming tension of \"Cavity.\" ~ Fred Thomas",

Light, soulful, and jazzy, Moondance opens with the sweetly nostalgic \"And It Stoned Me,\" the song's pastoral imagery establishing the dominant lyrical motif recurring throughout the album. At the heart of the record is \"Caravan,\" an incantatory ode to the power of radio; equally stirring is the majestic \"Into the Mystic,\" a song of such elemental beauty and grace as to stand as arguably the quintessential Morrison moment. ~ Jason Ankeny",

        "summary": "Often pigeonholed as being prolific to a fault, Beck took an extended break from recording after the 2008 release of Modern Guilt. He kept himself busy, producing acclaimed albums for Charlotte Gainsbourg, Thurston Moore, and Stephen Malkmus & the Jicks, blowing off steam via his mischievous Record Club (an online series where he and his friends covered classic albums), and then easing back to original songwriting through the ambitious Song Reader project, a folio containing sheet music for 20 unrecorded songs. He also suffered a spinal injury in 2008, a fact not publicized until he was ready to release Morning Phase, his first album in six years, early in 2014. As Morning Phase is a slow, shimmering album deliberately in the vein of classic singer/songwriter LPs, it's easy to think of it as a pained, confessional sequel to Sea Change, the 2002 record written and recorded in the wake of a painful romantic breakup. Beck didn't shy away from these comparisons, calling it a \"companion piece\" to his acclaimed 2002 LP, and as \"Morning\" glimmers into view, sounding for all the world like \"Golden Age,\" it almost seems as if Beck covered himself as part of the Record Club. Morning Phase soon develops its own distinct gait, one that's a little more relaxed than its cousin. Crucially, Beck has swapped sorrow for mere melancholy, a shift in attitude that makes this 2014 album sweeter than its predecessor, a distinction sometimes distinguished by moments where words, traditionally the sadness signifiers for sensitive troubadours, are washed away by cascading waves of candy-colored sound. Underneath this warm, enveloping aural blanket lie some sturdily constructed compositions -- the haunting \"Heart Is a Drum,\" bringing to mind memories of Nick Drake; the loping country-rock \"Say Goodbye\" and its sister \"Country Down\"; \"Blue Moon,\" where the skies part like the breaking dawn -- but the abiding impression left from this album is one of comfort, not despair, which makes Morning Phase distinctly different than its companion Sea Change. [Morning Phase was also issued on vinyl.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "2011's Ceremonials, which found Florence + the Machine expanding on their already expansive sound, helped to further propel the ghostly Brit into the spotlight, and on MTV Unplugged, she's come full circle, allowing fans a peek into the bombast while providing the aging, acoustic show with a little defibrillation. It's all well and good, with a solid set list that includes favorites from both records along with a pair of oddball covers, but Florence Welch's stadium-sized persona fights for air within the gothic confines of New York City's historic Angel Orensanz synagogue. You can really feel her holding back on reliable show stoppers like \"Dog Days are Over,\" \"Cosmic Love,\" and \"Shake It Out,\" which is kind of the point for an unplugged session, but Welch's greatest strength is her ability to go from heartbreak to goose bumps without a bead of perspiration, and this well-played, technically sound set suffers a bit for its absence. That said, midtempo tracks like \"Only If for a Night,\" \"No Light, No Light,\" and \"What the Water Gave Me,\" the latter of which finds Welch in full control of the room by the song's second half, are soulful, spooky, and bold, allowing room for both Welch and her machine to strut their stuff without sounding like a murder of caged crows. ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "Some bands take their time coming into their own. Such is the case with Wolf Alice, who formed in 2010 but didn't release their debut album until 2015. During those five years, Ellie Rowsell and Joff Oddie -- who were joined by drummer Joel Amey and bassist Theo Ellis in 2012 -- explored styles ranging from folk-rock to gritty post-punk on their singles and EPs. My Love Is Cool reflects this growth and finds them sounding more eclectic than ever. The handful of singles that ended up on the album shows how Wolf Alice have refined their sound: \"Fluffy\" and \"Giant Peach\" offer the kind of searing, snarling rock that proves PJ Harvey and Silverfish are still their forebears, while \"Moaning Lisa Smile\" is both brash and ethereal, providing a bridge for the softer sounds they explore on My Love Is Cool. 4AD's classic roster provides plenty of inspiration for a good chunk of the album, with \"Freazy\" recalling not only Cocteau Twins' glassy sensuality but their penchant for impressionistic song titles. Meanwhile, Rowsell's wild-eyed glee as she sings \"I'm taking you down to hell!\" over loud-quiet-loud dynamics on \"You're a Germ\" evokes the Pixies, and the delicate opening track \"Turn to Dust\" has more in common with Blonde Redhead than any of Wolf Alice's previous music. Despite these enduringly hip reference points, the band also pulls off some moves on My Love Is Cool that are anything but typically cool. They're unafraid of power ballads and grand gestures, and songs like the mini-anthem \"Silk\" and the sweeping \"Bros\" -- which sounds like the missing link between Cocteau Twins and the Cranberries -- hint at stadium-sized potential. Later, \"Swallowtail\" (which features Amey on vocals) suggests the ability Gish-era Smashing Pumpkins had to be intimate and massive at the same time. Despite My Love Is Cool's many stylistic shifts, Wolf Alice don't sound like they're having an identity crisis. This is partly because songs like \"Lisbon\"'s barbed-wire pop tie the album's more disparate elements together, and partly because the band seems self-assured no matter what. Even if My Love Is Cool sacrifices some of Wolf Alice's earlier fury, the album is all the stronger for it. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "Roy Orbison's comeback started in 1986, when David Lynch used \"In Dreams\" for a pivotal sequence in his masterwork Blue Velvet. So mesmerizing was Dean Stockwell's pantomime of the 1963 hit that Orbison soon became in demand. He re-recorded his hits for a collection naturally called In Dreams, he gave a star-studded concert called Black & White Night, and then he began work with ELO leader Jeff Lynne on a comeback album. The duo tabled the album to join the supergroup the Traveling Wilburys, a collaboration with Tom Petty, George Harrison, and Bob Dylan that turned into a surprise smash in 1988. Once that record began its run up the charts, Lynne and Orbison completed the album that became Mystery Girl, but the record didn't come out until February 1989, a few months after Roy's tragic death. His passing colored the reception of the record, helping turn it into a genuine hit -- it peaked at five on Billboard's 200 and two in the U.K. and went platinum in both countries -- and while his death may have helped boost sales, it's likely Mystery Girl would've been a success anyway. Orbison, unlike any of his '60s peers, was an actual hot property at the end of the '80s, and he surrounded himself with collaborators who cared enough to showcase him at his best. Lynne is the best known of these and his contributions are strong, although perhaps a bit too redolent of the Baroque pop that became his trademark at the turn of the '80s: they're big, bright, and bold, slathered in harmonies and guitars, their over-production obscuring the songs' simple charms. \"You Got It,\" the hit from the record, perfectly captures this characteristic, but so do the other Lynne contributions \"A Love So Beautiful\" and \"California Blue,\" the latter in particular a very nice evocation of Roy's early-'60s balladry. \"In the Real World,\" a song co-written by Will Jennings and co-produced by Heartbreaker Mike Campbell along with Orbison and his wife Barbara, is in the same vein, acting as an explicit sequel to \"In Dreams,\" while \"Windsurfer\" touches upon a California pop Roy rarely attempted, and \"The Only One,\" co-written by his son Wesley, evokes a nice southern soul groove. The two showy collaborations with U2 (\"She's a Mystery to Me\") and Elvis Costello (\"The Comedians\") garnered headlines at the time but are a shade florid -- Costello's melodrama edges out Bono & the Edge, because it respects pacing -- but T-Bone Burnett's \"(All I Can Do Is) Dream You\" is the real surprise, a nifty resuscitation of Roy's early rockabilly sides for Sun. The fact that all involved found a way to get a bit of swing into this attractive, overwrought pop illustrates just how handsome the whole endeavor is: it's designed as a graceful coda to a legendary career and, amazingly enough, it succeeds. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "As a songwriter for other contemporary pop stars, Ryan Tedder has proven his talent for writing intensely catchy songs that stick in people's heads whether they like it or not. But of course, plenty of people do like it, as evidenced not only by Tedder's success producing songs for such artists as Adele, Leona Lewis, and Maroon 5, but also with his own band, OneRepublic. And as with 2006's Dreaming Out Loud and 2009's Waking Up, OneRepublic's 2013 third studio album, Native, once again gives Tedder a vehicle to turn his hitmaking abilities on himself, and in the process, steal just a little bit of the spotlight away from his more recognizable clients. And why shouldn't he? Tedder has a burnished, resonant singing voice and a passionate, emotive vocal style that's perfectly suited for the uplifting crossover songs he so expertly writes. And that's kind of the dilemma for Tedder and OneRepublic, now three albums out. How do they stand out in a sea of other artists who sound so similar to them, primarily because as a songwriter, Tedder has largely defined much of the entire modern pop sound? In many ways, OneRepublic are a clearing house for mainstream pop sensibilities, and Native is no exception, with songs such as \"If I Lose Myself Again,\" \"I Lived,\" and \"Au Revoir\" touching upon the soaring, piano-driven alt-rock of Coldplay, the funky, synthetic, blue-eyed-soul of Maroon 5, and the slick yet earnest R&B balladry of any number of modern divas. Which isn't to say that the songs on Native are unremarkable. On the contrary, Tedder reveals a broad palette of stylistic inspiration, and cuts like the roiling, romantic \"Light It Up\" and atmospheric and yearning \"Can't Stop\" touch upon the ruminative qualities of indie rock, the falsetto-heavy tones of Prince-style lead vocals, and the wide-eyed drama of '80s Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush. In some ways, Tedder's talent lies in re-appropriating the latest pop trend to fit his own songwriting style. Here, on tracks like \"Counting Stars,\" Tedder has clearly been listening to the British folk-rockers Mumford & Sons and, as evidenced by the percussive operatic of \"Feel Again,\" Florence and the Machine. Of course, with Tedder having possibly worked with any one of the artists mentioned here prior to recording Native, one could argue that he's merely re-appropriating his own sound. Ultimately, all of this might seem like more of a knock against OneRepublic as pop opportunists, if the music weren't so dang catchy. [A Deluxe Edition added five bonus tracks.] ~ Matt Collar",

        "summary": "Essentially a harder-rocking reprise of Every Picture Tells a Story, Never a Dull Moment never quite reaches the heights of its predecessor, but it's a wonderful, multi-faceted record in its own right. Opening with the touching, autobiographical rocker \"True Blue,\" which finds Rod Stewart trying to come to grips with his newfound stardom but concluding that he'd \"rather be back home,\" the record is the last of Stewart's series of epic fusions of hard rock and folk. It's possible to hear Stewart go for superstardom with the hard-rocking kick and fat electric guitars of the album, but the songs still cut to the core. \"You Wear It Well\" is a \"Maggie May\" rewrite on the surface, but it develops into a touching song about being emotionally inarticulate. Similarly, \"Lost Paraguayos\" is funny, driving folk-rock, and it's hard not to be swept away when the Stonesy hard rocker \"Italian Girls\" soars into a mandolin-driven coda. The covers -- whether a soulful reading of Jimi Hendrix's \"Angel,\" an empathetic version of Dylan's \"Mama, You Been on My Mind,\" or a stunning interpretation of Etta James' \"I'd Rather Go Blind\" -- are equally effective, making Never a Dull Moment a masterful record. He never got quite this good ever again. [A limited-edition remastered CD was released in 2014.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Nevermind was never meant to change the world, but you can never predict when the zeitgeist will hit, and Nirvana's second album turned out to be the place where alternative rock crashed into the mainstream. This wasn't entirely an accident, either, since Nirvana did sign with a major label, and they did release a record with a shiny surface, no matter how humongous the guitars sounded. And, yes, Nevermind is probably a little shinier than it should be, positively glistening with echo and fuzzbox distortion, especially when compared with the black-and-white murk of Bleach. This doesn't discount the record, since it's not only much harder than any mainstream rock of 1991, its character isn't on the surface, it's in the exhilaratingly raw music and haunting songs. Kurt Cobain's personal problems and subsequent suicide naturally deepen the dark undercurrents, but no matter how much anguish there is on Nevermind, it's bracing because he exorcises those demons through his evocative wordplay and mangled screams -- and because the band has a tremendous, unbridled power that transcends the pain, turning into pure catharsis. And that's as key to the record's success as Cobain's songwriting, since Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl help turn this into music that is gripping, powerful, and even fun (and, really, there's no other way to characterize \"Territorial Pissings\" or the surging \"Breed\"). In retrospect, Nevermind may seem a little too unassuming for its mythic status -- it's simply a great modern punk record -- but even though it may no longer seem life-changing, it is certainly life-affirming, which may just be better. [For its 20th Anniversary, Universal released two deluxe editions of Nirvanaâs Nevermind, the first a two-disc set that contained all of the albumâs B-sides, the Hoarmoaning EP, live BBC sessions, and early sessions recorded at Smart Studios, along with previously unreleased rehearsal versions recorded on a boom box. The second, Super Deluxe edition has these two discs, plus a third CD with âThe Devonshire Mixes,â which is essentially Butch Vig's early rough mix of the album before it was handed over to Andy Wallace, a fourth CD containing a live concert at Seattleâs Paramount Theater on Halloween, 1991, given just weeks after the release of Nevermind, a concert thatâs also available as a DVD in this LP-sized deluxe book. A good chunk of the music on the first two discs is available elsewhere, either on Incesticide or the With the Lights Out box, or on B-sides that are fairly easy to acquire, yet to have all this material collected in one place is not only handy, it helps jolt Nevermind out of the history books, all the loose ends and mess showcasing Nirvana at its unruly best. And there are moments on the Smart Sessions that sound positively lethal, particularly the early version of âBreed,â then called âImmodium,â and despite their rickety fidelity, the Boombox Rehearsals contain a similar power. In comparison, the original Vig mix of Nevermind doesnât sound have quite the same level of revelation -- itâs heavier on the bottom end, there arenât quite as many guitar effects, the singles arenât as polished, âTerritorial Pissingâ loses its piss-take âGet Together\" intro and âOn a Plainâ outro -- sounding like something of a bridge between Bleach and Nevermind as we know it, while the Live show is positively celebratory, capturing the group just as the phenomenon exploded, long before it overwhelmed them. Ultimately, thatâs the great thing about either deluxe version of Nevermind: it shakes the sad specter of Kurt Cobain the tortured poet and restores the fun and fury of a great rock & roll band at their peak.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Jeff Lynne reportedly regards this album and its follow-up, Out of the Blue, as the high points in the band's history. One might be better off opting for A New World Record over its successor, however, as a more modest-sized creation chock full of superb songs that are produced even better. Opening with the opulently orchestrated \"Tightrope,\" which heralds the perfect production found throughout this album, A New World Record contains seven of the best songs ever to come out of the group. The Beatles influence is present, to be sure, but developed to a very high degree of sophistication and on Lynne's own terms, rather than being imitative of specific songs. \"Telephone Line\" might be the best Lennon-McCartney collaboration that never was, lyrical and soaring in a way that manages to echo elements of Revolver and the Beatles without ever mimicking them. The original LP's second side opened with \"So Fine,\" which seems like the perfect pop synthesis of guitar, percussion, and orchestral sounds, embodying precisely what Lynne had first set out to do with Roy Wood at the moment ELO was conceived. From there, the album soars through stomping rock numbers like \"Livin' Thing\" and \"Do Ya,\" interspersed with lyrical pieces like \"Above the Clouds\" (which makes striking use of pizzicato bass strings).

        "summary": "If Day at the Races was a sleek, streamlined album, its 1977 successor, News of the World, was its polar opposite, an explosion of styles that didn't seem to hold to any particular center. It's front-loaded with two of Queen's biggest anthems -- the stomping, stadium-filling chant \"We Will Rock You\" and its triumphant companion, \"We Are the Champions\" -- which are quickly followed by the ferocious \"Sheer Heart Attack,\" a frenzied rocker that hits harder than anything on the album that shares its name (a remarkable achievement in itself). Three songs, three quick shifts in mood, but that's hardly the end of it. As the News rolls on, you're treated to the arch, campy crooning of \"My Melancholy Blues,\" a shticky blues shuffle in \"Sleeping on the Sidewalk,\" and breezy Latin rhythms on \"Who Needs You.\" Then there's the neo-disco of \"Fight from the Inside,\" which is eclipsed by the mechanical funk of \"Get Down, Make Love,\" a dirty grind that's stripped of sensuality. That cold streak on \"Get Down, Make Love\" runs through the album as a whole. Despite the explosion of sounds and rhythms, this album doesn't add up to party thanks to that slightly distancing chilly vibe that hangs over the album. Nevertheless, many of these songs work well on their own as entities, so there is plenty to savor here, especially from Brian May. Whether he's doing the strangely subdued eccentric English pop \"All Dead, All Dead\" or especially the majestic yet nimble rocker \"It's Late,\" he turns in work that gives this album some lightness, which it needs. And that's the reason News of the World was a monster hit despite its coldness -- when it works, it's massive, earth-shaking rock & roll, the sound of a band beginning to revel in its superstardom. [A 1994 digital version added a bonus mix of \"We Will Rock You.\"] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "At 27 years old, Dan Mangan sometimes sounds like one of those old-soul songwriters who takes cues from previous generations and sings with the dirty, weathered croon of someone approaching middle age. On his second album, though, the Canada native throws some curve balls into the mix. âRobots need love, too/They want to be loved by you,â he sings on the second track, which begins as an acoustic tune before expanding into a stomping, horn-filled singalong. Auxiliary instruments surface throughout Nice, Nice, Very Nice, throwing some refreshing quirkiness into an album that sometimes leans too heavily on sad, stripped-down folk. When Mangan scales back the arrangements, as he does on âThe India Queens Are Waiting,â the results are tuneful but somewhat anonymous, as if heâs content to blaze the same trail as fellow folkster Bon Iver. Itâs during the unexpected moments -- the quick crescendos in âYou Silly Git,â the electric guitar riffs in âTinaâs Glorious Comeback,â and the dynamic opening track -- that he carves out a unique identity, and there are enough moments here to make this a pleasant follow-up. ~ Andrew Leahey",

        "summary": "Queen were straining at the boundaries of hard rock and heavy metal on Sheer Heart Attack, but they broke down all the barricades on A Night at the Opera, a self-consciously ridiculous and overblown hard rock masterpiece. Using the multi-layered guitars of its predecessor as a foundation, A Night at the Opera encompasses metal (\"Death on Two Legs,\" \"Sweet Lady\"), pop (the lovely, shimmering \"You're My Best Friend\"), campy British music hall (\"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon,\" \"Seaside Rendezvous\"), and mystical prog rock (\"'39,\" \"The Prophet's Song\"), eventually bringing it all together on the pseudo-operatic \"Bohemian Rhapsody.\" In short, it's a lot like Queen's own version of Led Zeppelin IV, but where Zep find dark menace in bombast, Queen celebrate their own pomposity. No one in the band takes anything too seriously, otherwise the arrangements wouldn't be as ludicrously exaggerated as they are. But the appeal -- and the influence -- of A Night at the Opera is in its detailed, meticulous productions. It's prog rock with a sense of humor as well as dynamics, and Queen never bettered their approach anywhere else. [An LP version was reissued in 2008.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

Night Falls Over Kortadela is witty, pretty, silly, and wise; and filled with instantly memorable melodies, thrilling moments of surprise in the arrangements, and laugh-out-loud lyrics. As always, he draws from a wide range of musical influences, mixing in deft samples from sources as varied as Renaldo & the Loaf and fellow Swedes the Tough Alliance, and always sounding like a guy who is head over heels in love with music. This love translates into the joyous atmosphere that spills over the record like candy from a piÃ±ata as he leaps from disco-fied love songs (the blissful \"Sipping on the Sweet Nectar\") to doo wop-meets-hip-hop ballads (\"Kanske Ãr Jag KÃ¤r I Dig\"), from orchestral declarations of devotion (\"And I Remember Every Kiss,\" with orchestra on loan from Enoch Light) to delightfully ramshackle rockers (\"Friday Night at the Drive-In Bingo\"). Lekman mixes and matches sounds and genres like the world's most adept DJ, coming up with practically his own style in the process. It's hard to think of another artist who so gracefully blends the acoustic with the electric, the real with the fake. Lyrically Lekman sticks mostly to love, finding it, losing it, sacrificing for it (his story of being his friend's boyfriend to fool her father on \"A Postcard to Nina\" provides the album's lyrical highlights), but most of all believing in it wholeheartedly. He also shows his talent for capturing the small moments of life -- whether it's cutting the tip of your finger off while slicing avocados (\"Your Arms Around Me\") or worrying about your little sister (\"The Opposite of Hallelujah\") -- hasn't dimmed at all. Jens Lekman is a craftsman, a showman, and a magician all wrapped up into one tuneful bundle of joy, and Night Falls Over Kortadela is his best album. It'll have you walking in the clouds before the first song is half over and have you filled with happiness for days afterward. What more could you ask for? ~ Tim Sendra",

        "summary": "Historically, there's a progression that bands usually follow before their sound goes full-on arena rock. Things will start small and gritty, and then as the fame and crowds build, the sound changes to match the massiveness of the venues. However, on their debut album, Imagine Dragons buck tradition and swing straight for the cheap seats, doing away with generations of sonic evolution in favor of the huge, arena-made sound of Night Visions. Dramatic and sweeping, the Las Vegas band works in the same vein as pop giants Coldplay, offering up track after track of hooky and emotional midtempo jams. While a move like this might seem overly ambitious for a freshman band, Imagine Dragons are able to pull the sound off, with songs like the already ubiquitous, seemingly soundtrack-ready \"It's Time\" having no trouble worming their way into whatever part of the brain it is that likes to trap songs against listeners' will. The problem is, while the band's electronically reinforced sound is definitely big, it sometimes feels as though it lacks depth. Despite this, \"Every Night\" will certainly have some listeners unconsciously reaching for a lighter to wave in the air before they realize what they're doing, and it's exactly these kinds of surface pleasures that we turn to pop music for in the first place. What this means is that even though Imagine Dragons might have skipped a few steps along the way to their arena sound, Night Visions is still an album that, at least for a few minutes at a time, will make everyday life seem just a little bit bigger.

        "summary": "Many will find the broodingly hopeful sounds of L.A.'s (unfortunately named) NO to be a comforting salve in this confusing and hectic world. Their world-weary delivery and darkly textured music speaks of middle-aged disappointments and dreams/careers/relationships that didn't quite pan out. With their debut LP, El Prado, the band pick up where their 2011 EP Don't Worry, You'll Be Here Forever left off -- trying to pick up the pieces and earn a second chance with familiar-sounding, atmospheric, adult indie rock. Like a slightly more optimistic, west coast version of the National or a slightly less-creative version of Elbow, NO adopt the sort of muted romanticism gained by years of life experience. They sound like the band that's formed after its members' more ambitious first bands threw in the towel, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. El Prado is well-played and well-produced and if there is a lack of overall distinction, it's still as comforting as a Hudson Bay wool blanket. Subtly anthemic songs like \"Last Chance\" and \"Hold On\" are as reassuring as their titles suggest, with warmly delayed guitars and singer Bradley Hanan Carter's tuneful, rumbling voice intoning lines about lonely footsteps and winding roads that lead home. The overall sonic tone of El Prado is bottom-heavy, with richly produced drums and bass, deep, fuzzy guitar riffs, and low piano and synth textures throughout making for a moody atmosphere that ultimately helps power Carter's yearning lyrics. Fighting against the adversity of their own name, NO put a light on in the dark and turn in a reliable, if slightly unoriginal debut that goes down like mildly hopped, easy drinking craft brew. ~ Timothy Monger",

The band enlisted Morgan Kibby -- best known for her work with M83 and as White Sea -- as the album's co-producer, and she helps them translate those acts' expansive, synth-driven euphoria to their winsome songs. These influences are particularly strong on \"Marfa\" and \"Nothing Below,\" both of which find Wildcat! Wildcat! at their most ambitious. Elsewhere, the singles \"Hero\" and \"Holloway (Hey Love)\" boast massive choruses to match their widescreen production and romantic leanings, while \"Circuit Breaker\" and \"Garden Grays\" show off the band's slightly grittier, more intimate side. An engaging debut, No Moon at All's lighter-than-air songs offer lots of crowd-pleasing potential. [No Moon at All was also released on LP.] ~ Heather Phares",

Lead single \"Zombie\" is the offender in this regard -- the heavy rock trudge isn't immediately suited for the band's strengths (notably, O'Riordan wrote this without Noel Hogan) -- while the subject matter (the continuing Northern Ireland tensions) ends up sounding trivialized. Opening cut \"Ode to My Family\" is actually one of the band's best, with a lovely string arrangement created by O'Riordan, her overdubbed vocals showing her distinct vocal tics. Where No Need succeeds best is when the Cranberries stick at what they know, resulting in a number of charmers like \"Twenty One,\" the uilleann pipes-touched \"Daffodil's Lament,\" which has an epic sweep that doesn't overbear like \"Zombie,\" and the evocative \"Disappointment.\" [No Need to Argue was re-released on LP in 2016.] ~ Ned Raggett",

        "summary": "Beirut's fourth full-length album, No No No, has songwriter/singer Zach Condon swaying away from 2011's more indie pop The Rip Tide back toward the European folk-infused eccentricity of the band's first two LPs, and hanging out somewhere in between. With a flock of instruments ranging from piano, guitars, bass, and percussion to brass, strings, ukulele, and a selection of vintage synths and electronic organs, the songs are rarely sparse and often whimsical -- a diversion from more typical indie rock fare, as has been Condon's calling card since the beginning. While there are several electronic instruments on No No No, the experience is that of an acoustic jamboree. The bouncy opening track, \"Gibraltar,\" for instance, highlights bongo-type drumming, piano, handclaps, and Condon's distinctive, humming vocal tone over synths. The serene instrumental interlude, \"As Needed,\" actually is entirely acoustic. Synthesizers and organs are much more prevalent on the title track, including its '80s video game-like intro and rhythmic keyboard intervals, but it still plays like a roaming street band, with colorful brass, hand-held percussion, and Eastern European folk scales. Elsewhere, \"Fener\" is a bright, celeste-stippled tune, and the laid-back \"August Holland\" and strolling \"Perth\" are mellow but with churning grooves befitting pre-Saturday night rituals. The overall effect of the album is similarly steady and reflective yet toe-tapping. A perhaps surprising tone not reflective of Condon's turbulent personal life during the four-year break since The Rip Tide, which included divorce and hospitalization, No No No is a feel-good mean of the band's prior releases that should appeal to the Beirut loyal as well as serve as a fine representative for any potential admirers who've simply managed to miss them along the way. ~ Marcy Donelson",

        "summary": "Australian duo Big Scary's sophomore full-length album, 2014's Not Art, showcases the band's melodic, atmospheric, and stylistically varied sound. It follows up the duo's 2011 album, Vacation, and expands upon that album's more ruminative vibe with a dose of catchy, somewhat dance-leaning material. Whether it's flirting with anthemic '80s noise rock Ã  la the Jesus and Mary Chain, or kicking out some contemporary indie electronic dance jams Ã  la MGMT, Big Scary's Tom Iansek and Joanna Syme make passionate music that often sounds bigger and more robust than their duo designation might imply. All of which is to say that while all of the songs on Not Art flow together quite well, it's hard to pin Big Scary down to one style. Tracks like the opening \"Hello, My Name Is\" and the raucous \"Belgian Blues\" are gigantic, drama-fueled rockers that build and swell as much as any Ocean Rain-era Echo and the Bunnymen single. Elsewhere, Big Scary evince a fractured, intimate quality, and cuts like the digital, breakbeat-influenced \"Luck, Now\" and the breezy, melancholy \"Twin Rivers\" lean more toward the languid, cinematic adult contemporary sound of Peter Gabriel. In that sense, Big Scary also fit nicely alongside such similarly inclined bands as Canada's Young Galaxy, Portland's Viva Voce, and New Zealand's the Naked and Famous. After listening to Not Art, it's easy to see why the album, released in Australia in 2013, received several accolades including winning the Triple J Australian Album of the Year award, the Best Independent Release at the ARIAs, and the AIR Awards Best Independent Album. Simply put, Big Scary are scary good. ~ Matt Collar",

        "summary": "Released to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Frank Sinatra's death, Nothing But the Best is indeed one of the best single-disc compilations ever released on Sinatra. This isn't a career overview, however, since it begins with his inaugural Reprise recordings circa 1960 and surveys the rest of the '60s (including only two tracks not from the '60s). This was the age of Sinatra as the hard-swinging Chairman of the Board, illustrated perfectly by \"Luck Be a Lady\" and \"My Kind of Town.\" But it was also the age of wistful, middle-aged material like \"Summer Wind,\" \"Strangers in the Night,\" and, of course, \"It Was a Very Good Year.\" And it was also the age when Sinatra had the freedom to record with everyone he wanted to record with, whether it was Count Basie or Antonio Carlos Jobim or his daughter Nancy (the latter on the 1967 chart-topper \"Somethin' Stupid\"). All of those periods are represented on Nothing But the Best, which takes its place above the best previous Reprise collection, Sinatra Reprise: The Very Good Years, even though it somehow omits one of his classics, \"Love and Marriage.\" For this compilation, Reprise also commissioned new 2008 remasters of each track, which sound better than any previous, and added a new bonus track: a version of \"Body and Soul\" with a vocal recorded in 1984 laid over a 2007 arrangement by Torrie Zito and Frank Sinatra, Jr. ~ John Bush",

        "summary": "The problem with the recent spate of \"number one\" collections from the pop elite -- the Beatles, Michael Jackson, and now the Bee Gees -- is that they're consistently marketed as \"greatest-hits\" collections. The conceptual weight of \"number one\" singles for the average listener is about as heavy as the slabs of wax they came out on, and compiling an entire record around them only shines the spotlight on the tracks that suffered the cut. In the Bee Gees' case, it's the omission of classics like \"Nights on Broadway,\" \"New York Mining Disaster 1941,\" \"If I Can't Have You,\" and \"More Than a Woman\" -- the latter does appear on the European versions -- that causes Number Ones to pale in comparison to 2001's highly superior Their Greatest Hits: The Record. [Number Ones was also released with a bonus track, \"Immortality.\"] ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "They may have climbed up into Australian's popular approval prior to Odyssey Number Five with the ease of a nearby dumbwaiter, but North America began to look like more of a challenging proposition. Surely being included on the Mission Impossible 2 soundtrack, roping in Pearl Jam and Stone Temple Pilots knob-twiddler Nick DiDia, and touring with Coldplay made all the sense in the world from a publicist point of view. But what about those pesky songs? That's the thing: This record is little more than a slightly off-base perspective into the world of mid-'90s American grunge and its conspicuous debt to Neil Young. At least when this tactic is taken, the album is a mildly enjoyable jaunt through the pebbles of unchallenging rock. The title track takes Placebo -- sneers and all -- and places them in a pair of stadium trousers; single \"My Happiness\" drowns a hip-hop-inspired guitar riff better than most bands of their stature. Too often, though, Powderfinger is too earnest, a bit too careful in their career, for the record to rise above the trap of seeking the mythic Valley of American Gold, once again proving that there are few things more destructive to a band's strengths than a careful marketing strategy.

        "summary": "The anxious and modern children of indie rock and new wave, OK Go will always have something you can love. In 2002, it was a squelchy, three-minute summation of what made the Pixies great called \"Get Over It.\" Three years later, it's a savvy batch of songs that are as perfectly arranged as those natty suits the quartet wears in Oh No's photos; perhaps a little calculated, but too prickly with excitement to really ignore. As tense and bursting as it is hooky and efficient, \"Do What You Want\" sounds a lot like the Hives. But it could also be a sly and modern Escape Club. This continues with \"Here It Goes Again\" and \"Good Idea at the Time,\" songs that cut too jaggedly to be opportunistic revivalism but still whir with new wave's wiggy energy. Fans of OK Go's first album will love \"No Sign of Life\" and the weirder \"Oh Lately It's So Quiet,\" while \"Crash the Party\"'s 1000-watt tingle is more the speed of Oh No. OK Go has written an album that coats its incredibly accessible nuts and bolts with an effervescent rocket sauce. It's got that unique zing, the one that says \"modern rock sensation!\" on the label. ~ Johnny Loftus",

        "summary": "The Shins' first full-length is a definitive indie rock album of the 2000s not just because of its thoughtful, tuneful songs, but also because of the vivid portrait it painted of indie culture. After the high irony of Pavement and other '90s standard bearers, indie rock began moving into more emotionally forthright territory. Oh, Inverted World is the sound of realizing there's more to life than being a smart-aleck -- but also not being ready to open up completely. The album's first song, \"Caring Is Creepy,\" sums up the typical indie response to emotional situations with its title alone, but it also introduces James Mercer's delicate, dryly witty take on that attitude. Hyper-literate lyrics like \"It's a luscious mix of words and tricks\" suggest someone who's better with words than with feelings, yet Mercer's high, wavering tones -- which are as awkward as they are beautiful -- prove otherwise. Caring might be creepy, but it's hard to avoid; the rest of Oh, Inverted World chronicles this post-ironic vulnerability, wrapping it in jangly guitar pop that echoes the Kinks, Zombies, and Beach Boys. This may not be the most innovative sound, but it makes Mercer's boy-meets-girl, boy-runs-away, boy-comes-back, girl-runs-away travails all the more familiar and relatable. And, of course, just how good the album's songs are can't be overlooked. \"Know Your Onion\" practically jumps out of its skin, bursting with British Invasion riffs and angst that goes way beyond adolescence; \"New Slang\" tempers a yearning that curdles into bitterness with a beautiful melody and a ghostly falsetto coda. More importantly, all of Oh, Inverted World's songs hang together in an immensely satisfying way. \"Weird Divide\" is a backyard Pet Sounds; its winding melody channels that point in the summer when it's too hot to care much about anything, punctuating it with percussion that evokes incessant sprinklers. An airy feel runs through the album, from \"Girl on the Wing\"'s bird imagery and pristine harmonies to \"Girl Inform Me\"'s giddiness to \"One by One All Day\"'s psychedelic coda. As things wind down, \"Your Algebra\"'s spooky chamber pop and \"The Past and the Pending\"'s acoustic musing foreshadow the experiments The Shins undertook on later albums. Oh, Inverted World is so full of ideas and emotions, and so fully realized, that itâs hard to believe it's just 33 minutes long. Whether or not the album lives up to the breathless \"Itâll change your life!\" claims made about it in Garden State, the less ironic direction of 2000s indie begins here. ~ Heather Phares",

The band's major-label debut, Oh, What a Life, is a big, unapologetically upbeat collection of indie pop anthems with similarly unrepentant commercial ambitions that comes off a little like a folksy One Direction. These are songs that refuse to remain incarcerated behind neon earphone buds. Key cuts like the uplifting opener \"Believer,\" the heartfelt \"Luck,\" and the spirited lead single \"Best Day of My Life\" were made to fly freely so that they may attach themselves to summer movie trailers, inspirational television commercials, and American Idol loser/winner/special-needs contestant montages. They are so on the nose that the seasoned, big summer pop anthem fan never has time to react with anything other than a begrudging respect for their complete lack of nuance. Whether they're mining the handclap-happy \"Hey Ho\" antics of the aforementioned Lumineers (\"Luck\"), rounding off the already polished edges of pop-punk with a little banjo (\"Heart of Stone\"), or simply repurposing big-moment group vocal-led Arcade Fire-isms (everywhere), they're doing it on their own, very shrewd terms, and without the cruel restrictions of subtlety. ~ James Christopher Monger",

The anthemic guitar heroics present on Pablo Honey and even The Bends are nowhere to be heard here. Radiohead have stripped away many of the obvious elements of guitar rock, creating music that is subtle and textured yet still has the feeling of rock & roll. Even at its most adventurous -- such as the complex, multi-segmented \"Paranoid Android\" -- the band is tight, melodic, and muscular, and Thom Yorke's voice effortlessly shifts from a sweet falsetto to vicious snarls. It's a thoroughly astonishing demonstration of musical virtuosity and becomes even more impressive with repeated listens, which reveal subtleties like electronica rhythms, eerie keyboards, odd time signatures, and complex syncopations. Yet all of this would simply be showmanship if the songs weren't strong in themselves, and OK Computer is filled with moody masterpieces, from the shimmering \"Subterranean Homesick Alien\" and the sighing \"Karma Police\" to the gothic crawl of \"Exit Music (For a Film).\" OK Computer is the album that establishes Radiohead as one of the most inventive and rewarding guitar rock bands of the '90s. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Vitalic has a certain playful mystique that goes beyond Pascal Arbez's invented back story of being a Ukrainian trubcka player and occasional gigolo from a family of sea otter fur traders. In fact, his inability to take anything too seriously, least of all the music he makes, may be the key to Vitalic's appeal. In an interview around the time that his full-length debut, OK Cowboy, was released, Arbez stated that he didn't listen to techno albums \"because they are boring,\" something that can't be said of this witty, stylistically omnivorous album. Acid house, techno, electro, rock, Gypsy melodies, and marches are mixed together into a sound that is both distinctly French (Eastern European pretensions aside, the comparisons to Daft Punk and Air are undeniable) and distinctly Vitalic. OK Cowboy collects Arbez's key singles and EP tracks, including everything from his much-loved 2001 Poney EP. \"Poney, Pt. 1\" and \"Poney, Pt. 2\" may still be Vitalic's best moments -- they're as eerie and emotional as they are hard-hitting and kinetic, with vocoders that are oddly scary and hilarious at the same time. The revving \"La Rock 01,\" however, doesn't fare quite as well; while it still moves, the best of OK Cowboy's newer tracks show how much Arbez's style has developed in the years between the EP and this album. \"My Friend Dario,\" the single that preceded OK Cowboy's release, is a standout: equal parts detached synth pop and head-banging hard rock, it's the poppiest Vitalic track yet, with vocals courtesy of Brigitte, a vocal-synthesis program that sounds as robo-sexy as a chick on speed. The video for the single -- which features electroclash fembots and heavy metal heshers meeting up and getting down Ã  la the legendary Aerosmith and Run-D.M.C. team-up \"Walk This Way\" -- nails the song's trashy, giddy vibe. Nearly all of OK Cowboy is just as vivid. \"Polkamatic\" wouldn't sound out of place at Star Wars' Mos Eisely Cantina, while \"The Past\"'s blobby analog synths conjure visions of '70s shag carpeting and extruded plastic furniture. As good as interlude-like tracks such as these are, Vitalic's greatest strength still lies in elegantly punishing dancefloor workouts like the excellent \"Newman\" and \"No Fun,\" another Brigitte-dominated track. Nevertheless, OK Cowboy is a full-fledged album, with a satisfying ebb and flow that shows that Arbez's sound has several sides to it. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "The Eagles began recording their third album in England with producer Glyn Johns, as they had their first two albums, but abandoned the sessions after completing two acceptable tracks. Johns, it is said, tended to emphasize the group's country elements and its harmonies, while the band, in particular Glenn Frey and Don Henley, wanted to take more of a hard rock direction. They reconvened with a new producer, Bill Szymczyk, who had produced artists like B.B. King and, more significantly, Joe Walsh. But the resulting album is not an outright rock effort by any means. Certainly, Frey and Henley got what they wanted with \"Already Gone,\" the lead-off track, which introduces new bandmember Don Felder as one part of the twin guitar solo that recalls the Allman Brothers Band; \"James Dean,\" a rock & roll song on the order of \"Your Mama Don't Dance,\" and \"Good Day in Hell,\" which is strongly reminiscent of Joe Walsh songs like \"Rocky Mountain Way.\" But the album also features the usual mixture of styles typical of an Eagles album. For example, \"Midnight Flyer,\" sung by Randy Meisner, is modern bluegrass; \"My Man\" is Bernie Leadon's country-rock tribute to the recently deceased Gram Parsons; and \"Ol' 55\" is one of the group's well-done covers of a tune by a singer/songwriter labelmate, in this case Tom Waits. The title track, meanwhile, points the band in a new R&B direction that was later pursued more fully. Like most successful groups, the Eagles combined many different elements, and their third album, which looked back to their earlier work and anticipated their later work, was a transitional effort that combined even more styles than most of their records did.

        "summary": "The Eagles recorded their albums relatively quickly in their first years of existence, their LPs succeeding each other by less than a year. One of These Nights, their fourth album, was released in June 1975, more than 14 months after its predecessor. Anticipation had been heightened by the belated chart-topping success of the third album's \"The Best of My Love\"; taking a little more time, the band generated more original material, and that material was more polished. More than ever, the Eagles seemed to be a vehicle for Don Henley (six co-writing credits) and Glenn Frey (five), but at the same time, Randy Meisner was more audible than ever, his two lead vocals including one of the album's three hit singles, \"Take It to the Limit,\" and Bernie Leadon had two showcases, among them the cosmic-cowboy instrumental \"Journey of the Sorcerer\" (later used as the theme music for the British television series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy). Nevertheless, it was the team of Henley and Frey that stood out, starting with the title track, a number one single, which had more of an R&B -- even a disco -- sound than anything the band had attempted previously, and continuing through the ersatz Western swing of \"Hollywood Waltz\" to \"Lyin' Eyes,\" one of Frey's patented folk-rock shuffles, which became another major hit. One of These Nights was the culmination of the blend of rock, country, and folk styles the Eagles had been making since their start; there wasn't much that was new, just the same sorts of things done better than they had been before. In particular, a lyrical stance -- knowing and disillusioned, but desperately hopeful -- had evolved, and the musical arrangements were tighter and more purposeful. The result was the Eagles' best-realized and most popular album so far. [One of These Nights was released on OGV LP in 2014.] ~ William Ruhlmann",

        "summary": "When MGMT were asked by their record label for a list of their dream producers, with low expectations they sarcastically replied: Prince, Nigel Godrich, Barack Obama, and \"not Sheryl Crow.\" Columbia returned with Dave Fridmann, the producer extraordinaire best known for his work with Flaming Lips and Mercury Rev. In typical Fridmann fashion, Oracular Spectacular is a glamorous mega-production through and through. Drums are massively distorted and shimmering keyboards are articulately layered as he takes the reins, leading the duo through his daisy chain of onboard compressors, delay units, and whatever other mysterious studio gizmos and gadgets he uses to get his trademark sound. Expectedly, the 14-karat polish enhances MGMT's blend of psychedelic and indie-electro to a shiny sonic gleam, resulting in some of the catchiest pop songs to come from N.Y.C. since the turn of the millennium. The tunes sound classic and new all at once, paying homage to Bowie, the Kinks, and the Stones, while updating traditional progressions with flashes of Royal Trux, Ween, and LCD Soundsystem. It's a wonderful mess of musical ideas, ranging from the dancy disco thump and Bee Gees falsetto of \"Electric Feel\" to the gritty acoustic-based \"Pieces of What,\" to the grimy synth groove on the anthemic \"Time to Pretend.\" With tongues planted firmly in cheeks, sardonic wit is as abundant as Andrew Van Wyngarden and Ben Goldwasser spoof the stereotypical rock & roll lifestyle with lines like \"Lets make some music, make some money, find some models for wives/I'll go to Paris take some heroin and fuck with the stars.\" Despite the ever-present irony, the songs never feel insincere and the record is inherently strong throughout, making it a solid start to their career. [Oracular Spectacular was released on LP in 2014.] ~ Jason Lymangrover",

The album's opener, \"Une Nuit a Paris,\" was nearly as marvelous; a sly and often hilarious extended parody of both cinematic stereotypes of life and love in France and overblown European pop. And side one's closer, \"Blackmail,\" was a witty tale of sex and extortion gone wrong, with a superb guitar solo embroidering the ride-out. That's all on side one; side two, however, is a bit spottier, with two undistinguished tunes, \"Brand New Day\" and \"Flying Junk,\" nearly dragging the proceedings to a halt before the band rallied the troops for a happy ending with the hilarious \"The Film of Our Love.\" The Original Soundtrack's best moments rank with the finest work 10cc ever released; however, at the same time it also displayed what was to become their Achilles' heel -- the inability to make an entire album as strong and memorable as those moments. ~ Mark Deming",

        "summary": "Soul Manifesto is a fancy but accurate title for what is essentially another installment in Rhino's Original Album Series, where all the individual albums are presented as mini-LPs in paper sleeves, slid into a small box, and marketed at a low price. In this case, this rounds up the 12 albums that form the core of the Otis Redding discography: the five studio albums he released between 1964 and 1967 (Pain in My Heart, The Great Otis Redding Sings Soul Ballads, Otis Blue: Otis Redding Sings Soul, The Soul Album, Complete & Unbelievable: The Otis Redding Dictionary of Soul, the Carla Thomas duet album King & Queen), the live albums Live in Europe and In Person at the Whisky a Go Go, and the four posthumous studio LPs released between 1968 and 1970 (The Dock of the Bay, The Immortal Otis Redding, Love Man, Tell the Truth). While other rarities were dug up years later -- two noteworthy sets are 1992's Remember Me and the following year's box set Otis! The Definitive Otis Redding -- this has all the important music Otis made, all delivered in a handy and affordable little box. If you didn't own this seminal music already, this is a great way to get it. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "On Our Endless Numbered Days, the follow-up to 2002's stunningly good Creek Drank the Cradle, the sound of Iron & Wine has changed but the song remains the same. No longer does Sam Beam record his intimate songs in the intimate surroundings of his home. Instead he has made the jump to the recording studio. As a result the record is much cleaner, less cocoon-like, certainly more the product of someone who has become a professional musician and not someone who just records for fun on a four-track. However, all Beam has sacrificed is sound quality. The sound of the record is still very intimate and simple, with very subtle arrangements that leave his voice and lyrics as the focal point. Luckily all the technology in the world can't affect Beam's voice, which still sounds like it comes right from his lips into your ear as if he were an angel perched on your shoulder. His songs are still as strong and memorable as they were on Creek, no drop off whatsoever in quality. \"Naked as We Came\" with sparkling melody lovely background harmonies by his sister Sara; the aching folk ballad \"Radio War,\" which wouldn't sound out of place on Prairie Home Companion, only it would be the best thing you ever heard there; the sad and sweet \"Each Coming Night\"; the crystalline acoustic guitar ballad \"Fever Dream,\" which has the kind of vocal harmony between Beam and his sister that seems to be the exclusive domain of siblings; and the soft rock CSNY \"Sodom, South Georgia\" are the equal of anything on Iron & Wine's debut and match up well with anything Palace, Smog, or their ilk have done lately. A definite plus to recording in a studio and enlisting the help of outside musicians is that there is much more variety to the album and there are lots of small production touches that liven things up like the Native American chants at the close of \"Cinder and Smoke,\" the pedal steel guitar on \"Sunset Soon Forgotten,\" and the drums and tambourine on the bluesy \"Free Until They Cut Me Down.\" Our Endless Numbered Days is very subdued, thoughtful, melodic, and downright beautiful album and the new sound is more of a progression than a sudden shift in values, production or otherwise. Anyone who found the first album to be wonderful will no doubt feel the same about this one. Heck, you might even like it more. [Initial quantities of Our Endless Numbered Days came with a bonus CD featuring home-recorded demos of \"Cinder and Smoke\" and \"Free Until They Cut Me Down,\" and two songs unavailable elsewhere that also sound home-recorded: \"Swans and the Swimming\" and \"Hickory.\" Anyone who loved the sound of the band's debut will be glad to hear these tracks, as they are dead ringers for tracks from that album. A nice bonus to a fine album.] ~ Tim Sendra",

        "summary": "The last ELO album to make a major impact on popular music, Out of the Blue was of a piece with its lavishly produced predecessor, A New World Record, but it's a much more mixed bag as an album. For starters, it was a double LP, a format that has proved daunting to all but a handful of rock artists, and was no less so here. The songs were flowing fast and freely from Jeff Lynne at the time, however, and well more than half of what is here is very solid, at least as songs if not necessarily as recordings. \"Sweet Talkin' Woman\" and \"Turn to Stone\" are among the best songs in the group's output, and much of the rest is very entertaining. The heavy sound of the orchestra, however, as well as the layer upon layer of vocal overdubs, often seem out of place. All in all, the group was trying too hard to generate a substantial sounding double LP, complete with a suite, \"Concerto for a Rainy Day.\" The latter is the nadir of the album, an effort at conceptual rock that seemed archaic even in 1977. Another chunk is filled up with what might best be called art-rock mood music (\"The Whale\"), before you finally get to the relief of a basic rocker like \"Birmingham Blues.\" Even here, the group couldn't leave well enough alone -- rather than ending it on that note, they had to finish the album with \"Wild West Hero,\" a piece of ersatz movie music that adds nothing to what you've heard over the previous 65 minutes. In its defense, Out of the Blue was massively popular and did become the centerpiece of a huge worldwide tour that earned the group status as a major live attraction for a time. [Out of the Blue was reissued in 2007 as a 30th Anniversary Edition with new photos, liner notes and three bonus tracks, including \"Quick and the Daft,\" \"Latitude 88 North\" and a home demo of \"Wild West Hero\".] ~ Bruce Eder",

        "summary": "Jean Michel Jarre, son of film composer Maurice Jarre, is one of the true pioneers of electronic music. Oxygene is one of the original e-music albums. It has withstood the test of time and the evolution of digital electronica. Jarre's compositional style and his rhythmic instincts were his strong points in 1976. While his popularity has escalated exponentially over the years, he never quite achieved the quality of this amazing recording. The innocence and freshness provide most of its charm. Jarre's techniques and ability provide the rest. This epic CD will appeal to fans of Tonto's Expanding HeadBand, Tangerine Dream, Synergy, Kraftwerk, and Klaus Schulze. ~ Jim Brenholts",

        "summary": "Soul Manifesto is a fancy but accurate title for what is essentially another installment in Rhino's Original Album Series, where all the individual albums are presented as mini-LPs in paper sleeves, slid into a small box, and marketed at a low price. In this case, this rounds up the 12 albums that form the core of the Otis Redding discography: the five studio albums he released between 1964 and 1967 (Pain in My Heart, The Great Otis Redding Sings Soul Ballads, Otis Blue: Otis Redding Sings Soul, The Soul Album, Complete & Unbelievable: The Otis Redding Dictionary of Soul, the Carla Thomas duet album King & Queen), the live albums Live in Europe and In Person at the Whisky a Go Go, and the four posthumous studio LPs released between 1968 and 1970 (The Dock of the Bay, The Immortal Otis Redding, Love Man, Tell the Truth). While other rarities were dug up years later -- two noteworthy sets are 1992's Remember Me and the following year's box set Otis! The Definitive Otis Redding -- this has all the important music Otis made, all delivered in a handy and affordable little box. If you didn't own this seminal music already, this is a great way to get it. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Even after selling nearly three million copies of her debut album worldwide, Lana Del Rey still faced a challenge during 2012: namely, proving to critics and fans that Born to Die wasn't a fluke. In that spirit, she released Paradise, a mini-album close to Christmas, one that finds her copying nearly wholesale the look and feel of her vampish Born to Die personality. The sound is also very familiar. Strings move at a glacial pace, drums crash like waves in slow motion, and most of the additional textures in these songs (usually electric guitar or piano) are cinematic in their sound and references. Del Rey is in perfect control of her voice, much more assured than she was even one year ago, and frequently capable of astonishing her listeners with a very convincing act, even while playing nearly the same character in each song. There's really only one difference between Born to Die and Paradise, but it's a big one. Instead of acting the softcore, submissive, '60s-era plaything, here she's a hardcore, wasted, post-millennial plaything. She even goes so far as to tell her audience that she likes it rough (in words that earned the album a parental advisory sticker), to ask whether she can put on a show, and at her most explicit, proffering a simile that compares the taste of an intimate part of her anatomy to Pepsi. Granted, at the age of 26, she still has a few things to learn about lyricism, also resorting to clichÃ© and baby talk in a manner that may fit the persona in a song, but doesn't result in great songwriting. (For examples, check \"Body Electric,\" with the lines \"Elvis is my daddy, Marilyn's my mother, Jesus is my bestest friend\" and \"We get crazy every Friday night, drop it like it's hot in the pale moonlight.\") For all the progress and growth Del Rey shows in the vocal realm, her songwriting appears to be in stasis and the productions behind her have actually regressed from Born to Die. (The inclusion of a cover, \"Blue Velvet,\" is not only a perfect match for her style, but also a hint that she performs up to better material.) Still, all of this is merely the fodder for her continuing controversy and popularity. Del Rey puts it better here than anyone else, with another simile: \"Like a groupie incognito posing as a real singer, life imitates art.\" ~ John Bush",

The sound is, as with the individual editions of each title, a significant improvement over any prior releases of this material and proves to be utterly impeccable, and the annotated booklet, containing the original credits and notes off the albums as well as the lyrics and all of the new annotation for each individual album by Bud Scoppa, is fairly handy. The problem is the packaging of the individual discs in miniature recreations of the original LP jackets, which are somewhat awkwardly stowed in one side of the box interior -- unless they're lined up perfectly, however, they will come out of that receptacle; additionally, as there are no inner sleeves for the CDs in their miniature jackets (a necessity and a courtesy provided by the Japanese when they issue CDs in miniature LP sleeves), it's easy for them to slide out of their jackets and get scratched and dinged even prior to purchase and opening. It's a shame that Columbia went to this kind of trouble in remastering and preparing this edition without seeing to such obvious details, and the result is a 50 dollar box set that is more inconvenient than it needed to have been. ~ Bruce Eder",

        "summary": "Listening to the Naked and Famous' guttingly good 2011 full-length debut, Passive Me Aggressive You, one thing is clear: this band loves a hot chorus. More often than not on the New Zealand indie electronic ensemble's album, songs like the immediately addictive leadoff cut, \"All of This,\" seem to be building to their catchy and cathartic pinnacle as soon as they start. Every fuzzed-out synth, distorted drumbeat, and slow-zipper guitar line seems to foretell of an impending dance-rock orgy of melody. This, all before you even get to the vocalists, with Alisa Xayalith's yearning and Thom Powers' exuberant croons. Sharing lead duties on and off as well as lending harmonies to each other, Xayalith and Powers alternately ground and elevate such towering anthems as the brutally infectious \"Punching in a Dream\" and the layered and shimmering \"Young Blood.\" This is '80s post-punk-influenced rock that never sounds too indebted to any of its obvious touchstones. In fact, you'd have to add caveats and descriptors to any comparison: i.e., âThey sound like an overdriven Tears for Fears,â âAn engorged OMD,â or  âHuman League as blasted through the blown-out speakers of a giant boombox.â Which isnât to say the Naked and Famous sound lo-fi, although there is some of that sound here, too. On the contrary, tracks like \"Eyes\" are positively grainy with emotion, while simultaneously appearing glossy, like neon-colored pop spaceships that zap you with precise, heartbeat rhythms and draw you in with tractor beams of melody. By the time you get to the ascendant album closer, âGirls Like You,â with its angsty repeated line \"Don't you know people write songs about girls like you?,\" it's almost as if the Naked and Famous are talking about themselves as much as addressing the listener. And in that sense, there's nothing passive about how much you could aggressively love this band. ~ Matt Collar",

        "summary": "How better to accurately convey the pain of breaking off a long-term relationship than to write and record songs about it with your ex-significant other? Apparently, Blake Hazard and John Dragonetti couldn't think of a more appropriate way, and what came out of those sessions (which eventually led to their reconciliation and marriage) was Declare a New State!, their first album as the band the Submarines. Needless to say, it's sad, pretty music that finds them reflecting about themselves and where they went wrong, never blaming anyone specifically but never accepting full responsibility, either. Each of them (they sing tracks both together and separately) puts pretty much everything out in the open for everyone to hear (\"On Super Tuesday I wanted to die...I'll never vote again,\" Dragonetti whimpers in \"Vote,\" referencing their breakup, which happened on the eve of the 2004 California presidential primary), leaving little to hide behind. This actually becomes kind of tiresome; it's as if the Submarines don't quite trust their audience to get their not-so-subtle references. In \"Brighter Discontent,\" Hazard sings lines like \"I rearranged the place a hundred times today/But the ordering of objects couldn't hide what's missing\" and \"All these things should make me happy...to be home again,\" rendering her point quite clear, but as if there were a possibility you might not understand her implications, she throws in a bridge with the phrase \"Love is not these belongings that surround me/Though there's meaning in the memories they hold\" to really drive things home, a gesture that while perhaps innocent enough, is not necessarily welcome. There are some wonderfully poignant lyrics in Declare a New State! as well (\"You got a way with words/Just sentiment without revealing how you feel,\" Hazard states in the gorgeous \"The Good Night\") that work well with the gentle guitar arrangements and melodies (which don't so much jump from the record as blend smoothly in with the layers of instrumentation) the band chooses to employ. It's all very nice, but there's not much that sticks when all is said and done, which is the album's biggest problem: its lack of distinctive qualities. It's not boring -- there are still a lot of drums and the occasional indie electronica effect on the record, but it's not going to leave any long-lasting impression, either. The music on Declare a New State! was certainly a useful tool for Dragonetti and Hazard, but it's a little too self-involved to do as much for anyone else. ~ Marisa Brown",

Thanks also to a more consistent set of songs, the results are magnificent -- given room to breathe, Joplin's trademark rasp conveys an aching, desperate passion on funked-up, bluesy rockers, ballads both dramatic and tender, and her signature song, the posthumous number one hit \"Me and Bobby McGee.\" The unfinished \"Buried Alive in the Blues\" features no Joplin vocals -- she was scheduled to record them on the day after she was found dead. Its incompleteness mirrors Joplin's career: Pearl's power leaves the listener to wonder what else Joplin could have accomplished, but few artists could ask for a better final statement. ~ Steve Huey",

        "summary": "During 1969 and 1970, CCR were dismissed by hipsters as a bubblegum pop band and the sniping had grown intolerable, at least to John Fogerty, who designed Pendulum as a rebuke to critics. He spent time polishing the production, bringing in keyboards, horns, even a vocal choir. His songs became self-consciously serious and tighter, working with the aesthetic of the rock underground -- Pendulum was constructed as a proper album, contrasting dramatically with CCR's previous records, all throwbacks to joyous early rock records where covers sat nicely next to hits and overlooked gems tucked away at the end of the second side. To some fans of classic CCR, this approach may feel a little odd since only \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain\" and maybe its B-side, \"Hey Tonight,\" sound undeniably like prime Creedence. But, given time, the album is a real grower, revealing many overlooked Fogerty gems. Yes, it isn't transcendent like the albums they made from Bayou Country through Cosmo's Factory, but most bands never even come close to that kind of hot streak. Instead, Pendulum finds a first-class songwriter and craftsman pushing himself and his band to try new sounds, styles, and textures. His ambition results in a stumble -- \"Rude Awakening #2\" portentously teeters on the verge of prog rock, something CCR just can't pull off -- but the rest of the record is excellent, with such great numbers as the bluesy groove \"Pagan Baby,\" the soulful vamp \"Chameleon,\" the moody \"It's Just a Thought,\" and the raver \"Molina.\" Most bands would kill for this to be their best stuff, and the fact that it's tucked away on an album that even some fans forget illustrates how tremendous Creedence Clearwater Revival really were. [The 40th anniversary edition of Pendulum included remastering as well as three bonus tracks: both parts of the single \"45 Revolutions Per Minute\" and a live version of \"Hey Tonight\" recorded in 1971.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "parentTitle": "The Radio Dept.",
        "summary": "In the chorus of Pet Grief's lead single and catchiest song, Radio Dept. head Johan Duncanson makes the touching if rather petty confession that the only reason he's able to withstand his jealous despair is the knowledge that his would-be romantic rival has \"the worst taste in music.\" Well, if it makes him feel better, there's certainly no doubting his and his bandmates' taste -- like their buzzy, buzzed-about debut, Pet Grief evinces an impeccably fashionable roll call of influences from British post-punk and shoegaze to more recent electronic indie and dream pop, and if that's not enough, the hook of \"What Will Give?\" offers the gratuitously hip reference: \"I want to hide, like Jandek before playing live.\" But taste only gets you so far -- if you're going to wear your influences on your sleeve, you'd better have your heart on it too, if not some other tricks up it as well. Lesser Matters had the heart, the humanity, the class, the confidence, and the pop chops, in spades, to pull off its stylish simulations without ever seeming rotely regurgitative, but this sophomore set, to some extent, lets its stylishness supersede its substance. It's not that Radio Dept. have dramatically altered their approach, although there are definitely discernible differences. The band's always somewhat fluid lineup is now down to three -- they've gained a keyboard player and lost a bassist and a drummer since the first full-length, and the (apparently intentional) effects are evident in an increased reliance on synthesized atmospherics and programmed drum machine beats, which still sound as gloriously cheap as ever. Their lush lo fi luster is only slightly diminished -- that is to say: these productions are, on the whole, slightly more polished, though they're still amply capable of generating that woozy, wistful warmth. And there's a somewhat streamlined feeling to the album in dynamic terms as well, with less song to song variety -- there are none of the shambolic, nearly twee numbers which were so effective interspersed among Lesser Matters' oceans of fuzz, and in fact, apart from the spirited, saturated \"Every Time,\" there's not even all that much distortion here. But the main issue is that songs themselves just aren't as engaging this time out. Duncanson's vocals are practically buried in reverb throughout, which certainly doesn't help matters on that count (though it arguably adds to the album's overall atmosphere), but even with repeated listens there are only a handful of numbers -- most notably \"Worst Taste\" and the title track -- which stand out as comparable to the remarkably consistent quality of the debut. It may be that they were just more interested in album-length ambience than stand-alone pop this time around -- a couple of brief, spacy instrumentals seem to suggest as much. In that sense the album must certainly be regarded as a success; it's a rich and evocative mood piece, and still eminently worth hearing. It's just a minor disappointment when a band so adept at bridging the style-substance divide decide to limit themselves to just one facet of their talents. ~ K. Ross Hoffman",

        "summary": "Never ones to shy away from complexity, the Punch Brothers throw all caution to the wind on The Phosphorescent Blues. Aided by producer T-Bone Burnett -- that auteur of Americana acoustica, who previously worked with the band on his soundtrack for the Coen brothers' folkie saga Inside Llewyn Davis -- the Punch Brothers indulge themselves in impressionism on their fourth full-length, having the guts to open with a ten-minute suite that plays a bit like the fourth side of a double-vinyl from 1971. It also performs a nifty trick of sorting out the true believers. If \"Familiarity\" -- the coziness of the title feels like a knowing joke, as it certainly doesn't follow conventional contours -- grabs a listener's attention with its elliptical ebb and flow, chances are the rest of the record will play smoothly as it dips into Debussy and scrapes by Scriabin, taking longer to linger on sunshine harmonies lifted from the Beach Boys than it does to revive an old string stomp like \"Boll Weevil.\" Backwoods and front-porch picking never were the Punch Brothers' thing, though. They're happily urban sophisticates, making leader Chris Thile's second group Nickel Creek appear to be purists, and the success of The Phosphorescent Blues lies in how they cheerfully embrace the well-manicured sophistication that comes with the territory where the air is rarefied. The Punch Brothers sound as comfortable nimbly skipping through classical pieces as they do creating oddly shaped bluegrass-prog -- and as they do creating sparkling pop miniatures like \"Magnet\" and \"Between 1st and A.\" By both capturing and fusing these two sides, The Phosphorescent Blues stands as a defining record for an admittedly restless band. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "parentTitle": "PHOX",
        "summary": "The eponymous debut album from the Baraboo, Wisconsin-based seven-piece is as unassuming as it is oddly decadent, offering up a heady mix of cosmopolitan, worldbeat-infused, yet still distinctly Midwestern-sounding indie pop and breezy collegiate folk that falls somewhere between Vampire Weekend, Norah Jones, Brazilian Girls, and Sade. These are songs meant to accompany late-night misadventures filled with sugary drinks, shimmering, post-skinny-dip neck lines, and exhaustive, yet never combative pre-dawn discussions about love, religion, sex, and death, and they're delivered with supreme lubrication via the soulful and hypnotic voice of formidable frontwoman Monica Martin. The evocative, stripped-down \"Calico Man\" sets the table, laying out a cool pastiche of bossa nova-kissed indie pop and de-fanged Brooklyn cool that deftly juggles melancholy and sweetness, serving as a nice intro to the string-laden, music school chamber pop of the more propulsive \"Leisure\" and \"Slow Motion.\" The band tightens up on the rolling \"1936,\" a loose and luxurious, summery earworm that explains why the group has shared some dates with fellow folk-pop confectioners the Lumineers, and that predilection for crafting likeable, slow-burn mixtape fodder that sits firmly on the angel's side of the listener's shoulder is furthered by the like-minded \"Kingfisher,\" \"Shrinking Violets,\" and the shape-shifting \"Evil,\" the latter of which manages to segue effortlessly from glitchy Afro-pop oddity to Burt Bacharach-infused road trip anthem. Phox is an undeniably tight unit, and their long history as friends imbues each track with a distinctive warmth that eludes similar-sounding acts, but their not-so-secret weapon is Martin, who can bend cliches to her will, and does so often throughout the 12-song set. [PHOX was also released on LP.] ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "The first full-length album from Fitz & the Tantrums (which recycles two tunes from their debut EP, 2009's Songs for a Break Up, Vol. 1), Pickin' Up the Pieces finds this L.A.-based sextet breaking out big time within the soul revival underground, though for a band that plays heavily on their D.I.Y. cred -- as their press materials frequently note, this album was primarily recorded in lead singer Michael Fitzpatrick's living room -- these songs find them playing to the polished and poppier end of the R&B spectrum. Principle songwriter Fitzpatrick and Tantrums' arranger James King (who also plays sax) lean to the more refined sounds of classic-era Motown, and the East Coast and Chicago styles that informed Northern soul, rather than the grittier Southern soul artists who recorded for Stax or Goldwax, and while these songs show a strong and obvious influence of classic â60s soul, there's more than a dash of contemporary pop in the way the hooks make themselves felt, the stylish layers of backing vocals, and the occasional use of drum loops. This is soul from the upscale night spot rather than the juke joint, but it's a club that's well worth the cover charge; Fitzpatrick is a significantly better than the average blue-eyed soul crooner, his vocal partner Noelle Scaggs is good enough that one wishes she got more space in the spotlight, and under King's direction, the band cuts an impressive groove without cluttering up the arrangements or depending too strongly on their influences to convincingly conjure the sound of the classic era of soul. Fitz & the Tantrums may lack some of the sweaty muscle of Sharon Jones & the Dap Kings, the current titans of the retro-soul scene, but this band is clearly going for a different approach, and on their own terms they've made a solid album that fuses past and present and creates a space that's a cool place to be.

        "summary": "TOPS come from a crew of Montreal-based creative types who collectively cobbled themselves together through loose affiliations with the Artbus Records label and the warehouse studio/performance space where many of the bands and artists of the scene experiment with their boundary-pushing ideas. While some of the most visible output connected to this particular sect of Montreal music-makers came in the form of Grimes' quirky electro pop and Blue Hawaii's melancholic indie minimalism, lesser-known players like Doldrums, Sean Nicholas Savage, and TOPS tapped into this strange collective energy with equally interesting and often far stranger results. With their second album, Picture You Staring, TOPS continue the muted, home-recorded take on jazzy sophisti-pop they began on 2012âs Tender Opposites. Singer Jane Penny's wispy, plaintive vocals are front and center of every song, but always a little bit out of focus, submerged in the blurry recording quality and always competing with guitarist David Carriere's wiry leads. Earlier recordings drew comparisons to Ariel Pink's wooly recording style, and the flange-coated guitars and lo-fi sheen of âCircle the Darkâ back up this reference point, sounding like Ariel Pink going through a heavy Fleetwood Mac phase. Moments later the airy âOutsideâ sounds enormous by comparison, with '80s dream-ballad synth tones and a chorus-heavy bass melody blatantly borrowed from Berlinâs âTake My Breath Away.â TOPS have their moments of '80s soundtrack nostalgia, but the album as a whole tends to be more complex and reaching. Threads of mystery and distance hold the album together, in both its dreamy, far-off moments (the reverb-glazed harmonies of lullaby âSleeptalkerâ) and its more direct, upbeat tunes (the weird jazz-funk shuffle of âSuperstition Futureâ or the bounding '80s-modeled dance pop of standout tune âChange of Heartâ). What makes Picture You Staring so deeply enjoyable is the bandâs acute sense of when to obscure their sound and when to let it shine through. Walking this tightrope, TOPS never go so far off the deep end of their experimental recording side to completely hide their sad-hearted hooks.

        "parentTitle": "Gorillaz",
        "summary": "Gorillaz began as a lark but turned serious once it became Damon Albarnâs primary creative outlet following the slow dissolve of Blur. Delivered five years after the delicate whimsical melancholy of 2005âs Demon Days, Plastic Beach is an explicit sequel to its predecessor, its story line roughly picking up in the dystopian future where the last album left off, its music offering a grand, big-budget expansion of Demon Days, spinning off its cameo-crammed blueprint. Traces of Albarnâs Monkey opera can be heard, particularly in the hypnotic Mideastern pulse of âWhite Flag,â but Damonâs painstaking pancultural pop junk-mining no longer surprises -- when hip-hop juts up against Brit-pop, itâs expected -- yet it still has the capacity to delight, no matter which direction the Gorillaz may swing. Lou Reedâs crotchety croak on âSome Kind of Natureâ has the same kind of gravitational pull as Mos Def leading the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble through the intensely circling âSweepstakes,â while the group reaches new heights of sparkling pop on âSuperfast Jellyfish,â aided by the return of De La Soul -- the rappers who propelled âFeel Good Inc.â -- and an appearance from Gruff Rhys, the Super Furry Animals frontman who is an ideal fit for Gorillaz (possibly because SFAâs genre-bending pop and Pete Fowler's artwork clearly paved the way for Albarn and Jamie Hewlettâs collaboration). A common thread among all these tracks is that they find Albarn ceding the spotlight to his fellow musicians, preferring to be the puppetmaster behind the curtain, and Plastic Beach works best when heâs the composer and producer, finding hidden strengths within his guests -- having Mick Jones and Paul Simonon for the elastic title track, coaxing some powerful performances out of Bobby Womack -- but often when Albarn takes center stage, his laconic drawl lets the air out of the balloon. Curiously, much of this arrives toward the beginning of the album, the record gaining momentum as it unspools, working toward its climax, but the overall album accentuates moody texture over pop hooks. This emphasis means Plastic Beach is the first Gorillaz album to play like a soundtrack to a cartoon -- which isnât entirely a bad thing, because as Albarn grows as a composer, heâs a master of subtly shifting moods and intricately threaded allusions, often creating richly detailed collages that are miniature marvels. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

(It's the only song from the EP to also be included in their 2012 full-length release, Moonwater.) \"Come Home\" is a legitimate introduction to the band, a typically infectious, melodic, uptempo love song with bluesy lyrics pleading \"Where are you?\" as the protagonist bargains for his lady's return (\"Take my clothes, take my clothes, my tight blue jeans/Take everything\"). \"Sci-Fi Bandits,\" about a space-age Bonnie and Clyde, is brimming with funk and still more sassy lyrics (\"We exit in our sci-fi green Pinto/We stored a portal on the floor, y'all/If you get in it, it transports any mortal\"). On top of the lyrics, the band's namesake and vocalist, Alex Chappo, is a rare entity (Marc Bolan, Michael Hutchence, Billie Holiday) who can smolder through a microphone. His exaggerated drawl and glottal stops are sure to induce smiles if his range and vulnerable swagger don't manage to. Recorded in the band's living room, which isn't necessarily a bad thing by the 2010s, some tracks here could benefit from less muddiness without sacrificing grit. However, the content overall is impressive, with lots of extra touches like constructive backing vocals, fuzz, and -- one doesn't find this every day -- outer space-themed effects. Plastique Universe does its job in establishing a clear tone for the band: the five tracks offer wall-to-wall psychedelic synths and sounds, rock & roll guitar, powerful grooves, melodic hooks, and sexy lyrics about space, love, and exploits, all with the promise of future danceable rock and smiles. ~ Marcy Donelson",

Issued in some European territories and exported to the U.S., the package is a straightforward two-for-one set, with nothing fancy -- just the albums, straight up, as they were originally released, with two jewel cases within a thin cardboard sleeve. Among the charted singles of the two albums are \"Honey,\" \"Porcelain,\" \"Natural Blues,\" \"Bodyrock,\" \"We Are All Made of Stars,\" \"In This World,\" and \"Extreme Ways.\" ~ Andy Kellman",

        "summary": "Clearly the focus of Please Mr. Postman (1961) -- the Marvelettes' debut long-player -- is the title track. However, fans of the early Motown sound will be interested not only in the vocalists' soulful and swinging leads, but contributions from burgeoning songwriters Berry Gordy, William \"Smokey\" Robinson, and Brian Holland as well. Although the Marvelettes personnel changed several times during their early-'60s prime, the lineup featured here includes co-leads Gladys Horton (vocals) and Wanda Young (vocals), along with Georgeanna Tillman (vocals), Katherine Anderson (vocals), and Juanita Cowart (vocals). By the time this album became available in late 1961, three months had passed since \"Please Mr. Postman\" concluded its seven-week run atop the R&B singles chart. In the interim, the record label mined the ladies' talent for a suitable follow-up. The closest to hail from the bunch would be the midtempo Wall of Sound-alike \"I Want a Guy\" which was relegated to the B-side of their next single, \"Twistin' Postman.\" That certainly isn't to intimate the remainder of the effort is subpar, but rather that lightening had yet to strike twice as Motown was continually refining the label's sound. The uptempo \"Angel\" is clearly rooted in then-recent R&B styles with more than a passing resemblance to another successful all-girl group. Specifically, the Chantels' and their Top 20 crossover ballad \"Maybe.\" To much the same end is the languid and bluesy doo wop-influenced \"So Long Baby,\" as well as the ballads \"Whisper\" and \"Oh I Apologize.\" The melodic \"I Know How It Feels\" joins Smokey Robinson and Berry Gordy's danceable \"Way Over There\" and the slightly Latin-tinged rave-up \"You Don't Want Me No More.\" Although Please Mr. Postman has been difficult to locate on compact disc, it is among the contents of Forever: The Complete Motown Albums, Vol. 1 (2009) box set from the Hip-O Select online audio boutique. ~ Lindsay Planer",

        "summary": "Once \"Please Please Me\" rocketed to number one, the Beatles rushed to deliver a debut album, bashing out Please Please Me in a day. Decades after its release, the album still sounds fresh, precisely because of its intense origins. As the songs rush past, it's easy to get wrapped up in the sound of the record itself without realizing how the album effectively summarizes the band's eclectic influences. Naturally, the influences shine through their covers, all of which are unconventional and illustrate the group's superior taste. There's a love of girl groups, vocal harmonies, sophisticated popcraft, schmaltz, R&B, and hard-driving rock & roll, which is enough to make Please Please Me impressive, but what makes it astonishing is how these elements converge in the originals. \"I Saw Here Standing There\" is one of their best rockers, yet it has surprising harmonies and melodic progressions. \"Misery\" and \"There's a Place\" grow out of the girl group tradition without being tied to it. A few of their originals, such as \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" and the pleasantly light \"P.S. I Love You,\" have dated slightly, but endearingly so, since they're infused with cheerful innocence and enthusiasm. And there is an innocence to Please Please Me. The Beatles may have played notoriously rough dives in Hamburg, but the only way you could tell that on their first album was how the constant gigging turned the group into a tight, professional band that could run through their set list at the drop of a hat with boundless energy. It's no surprise that Lennon had shouted himself hoarse by the end of the session, barely getting through \"Twist and Shout,\" the most famous single take in rock history. He simply got caught up in the music, just like generations of listeners did. [Please Please Me was re-released in mono on vinyl in 2014.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "It's been said that artists will truly know they've entered pop culture when Weird Al Yankovic records a parody of their hit. But what does it mean when pop culture is ahead of Weird Al? Take his parody of the Backstreet Boys' \"I Want It That Way,\" which Yankovic turns into \"eBay,\" but his satire is not far removed from the auction website's own advertising campaign of 2003, where people rave about the junk they bought on eBay to the tune of \"My Way\" (\"I did it eBay\"). What does this mean? Well, to begin with, that Weird Al's sensibility has been so thoroughly assimilated by mass culture that it's tougher than ever for him to stay ahead of the game, but it also means that he's getting predictable. Even worse for his music, he's getting older and he doesn't have a finger on the pulse of pop culture anymore. Like Bill O'Reilly ranting about how hip-hop will lead to the destruction of America (something he actually did on The O'Reilly Factor the week Poodle Hat was released), offering generalizations about a culture he doesn't understand, Yankovic seems removed from the culture he's commenting upon, picking up on cues he's heard on Clear Channel radio and read in Entertainment Weekly without exploring the music much itself. For instance, \"Angry White Boy Polka,\" his latest installment in his series of polka parody melodies, is undone by his lack of understanding of the subject, in particular how the White Stripes, the Strokes, and the Hives -- none of whom are angry in the slightest -- are the polar opposite of Limp Bizkit, Disturbed, and Papa Roach, and their nÃ¼-metal ilk (for that matter, Kid Rock is many things, but he ain't angry). Then, there's his parody of Eminem's \"Lose Yourself,\" for which Marshall Mathers refused to let Alfred Matthew Yankovic make a video -- an event that gave Poodle Hat a lot of press upon its spring 2003 release. It was the first time an artist denied Al the permission to make a video and all the press portrayed it as another time that Mr. Mathers turned stone-cold humorless in the face of a silly joke (it was Triumph the Insult Comic Dog at the VMAs revisited); after hearing Yankovic's \"Couch Potato,\" it's hard not to sympathize with Em, since unlike his other big pop hit parodies, this has nothing to do with the song. Weird Al doesn't pick up on the theme of the song, or the sound of it, or the lyrics to create a parody, he simply picks television at random, as if jokes about American Idol and Survivor will guarantee laughs and airplay. On top of the randomness of the subject, the jokes are simply bad, culminating in a \"My Tivo Thinks I'm Gay\" joke ripped off from Mike Binder's unspeakably awful HBO series Mind of the Married Man, where it was done better (and if Mike Binder does a joke better than you, you're slipping; besides, anybody who has had Tivo for any length of time knows that no matter what you do, it will record Law & Order). \r\nAnd so Poodle Hat goes, as it stumbles over the obviousness and awfulness of its parodies, which have also veered into a new level of stomach-churning vulgarity, whether it's the stinking rubbish on \"Trash Day\" (Nelly's \"Hott in Herre\") or the Avril Lavigne parody \"A Complicated Song,\" where the chorus becomes: \"Why did you have to make me so constipated?\" Only one other song parody remains, and it's \"Ode to a Superhero,\" which is Billy Joel's \"Piano Man\" reconfigured for Spider-Man. Weird Al also stumbles on the originals, particularly because many of them sound and feel like parodies: \"Party at the Leper Colony\" rides the Willie & the Hand Jive shuffle beat, while \"Wanna B Ur Lovr\" is a slow-funk jam that sounds like a parody of Beck parodying Prince and \"Bob\" is about, well, Bob Dylan, styled like \"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\" with Al singing in a nasal whine \"funny,\" cryptic lines like \"May a moody baby doom a yam?,\" all of which are revealed to be palindromes! Hardy har har. Yankovic redeems himself somewhat on the three remaining songs, with \"Hardware Store\" and its complicated, intricate vocal arrangement the most musically interesting piece here, rivalled by \"Why Does This Always Happen to Me?,\" a sensitive piano pop tune with a good send-up of narcissistic lyrics and nice, layered vocal harmonies; the latter benefits considerably from the presence of Ben Folds on piano, not in the least because this sounds exactly like a Ben Folds song. Then, the album ends with \"Genius in France,\" a multi-part epic that's equal parts Utopia-era Todd Rundgren, Frank Zappa, and They Might Be Giants; it certainly has its irritating moments, including the stodgy song-ending Grey Poupon aside, but it's the most ambitious and weirdest thing here, which counts for a lot, ending with a Grey Poupon joke. It works because, at his best, Weird Al is a very good musician with some clever ideas and a skilled band, so music that showcases that is best for him -- it helps put his corny jokes across. Here, nothing works, and he sounds old and out of step because of it. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Irish singer/songwriter James Vincent McMorrow turns expectations upside down on Post Tropical, his follow-up to debut, Early in the Morning. Though that record reached number one and went platinum in the U.K. with its quirky, folksy meld of soft vocals and acoustic and electric guitars. McMorrow shifts gears entirely here. Recorded in a Texas studio between the Rio Grande and Mexico, its production textures are made up of electronic beats, electric guitars, synths, samplers, and piano and other sundry instruments, mostly played by the artist. At the humid center of it all is McMorrow's tender, quietly passionate and soulful falsetto, hovering, haunting and diving into lyrics that are fraught with longing, desire, hope, passion, and sometimes desperation. Post Tropical is, at heart, a poetic soul record, albeit of the 21st century variety -- there isn't anything remotely retro here. First single and opening track \"Cavalier\" opens with a skeletal electric piano. McMorrow enters immediately. Guided by his voice, he gradually builds the tune into a breathtaking, lush soundscape. Even the horns and female backing vocals (provided by sleeve designer Emma Doyle) are so tastefully placed, they underscore the romance, haunted ache, and longing in his delivery. \"Red Dust\" commences with wordless call-and-response vocals, answered by a piano and his proper entrance with the lyrics, crooning into the rhythms as well as above them. McMorrow's stacked backing voices add texture to the simple melody while deep beats add dimension, creating a sense of desperation: \"...Sometimes my hands/they don't feel like my own/I need someone to love/I need someone to hold....\" \"Gold\" offers Baroque horns, layers of guitars, basses, and snares; they circle around the vocal to create a glorious, soul-infused pop. The title track opens with a lithe keyboard pulse and a subdued horn arrangement, as drums, fat brass, and a throbbing synth bassline create a sonic maelstrom, but the singer, aided by numerous backing vocal layers, rises to meet them. Suddenly it all drops as the sound of a steel guitar playing a melody reminiscent of Nigerian high life enters to create a sharp contrast and it becomes an intimate, sunny groover. \"Glacier\" opens as a piano ballad but its handclaps, drums, beats, synths, strings, and choral backing transform it into a nearly jaunty pop number. Its well-crafted songwriting, enigmatic production, and arrangements, around McMorrow's gorgeous voice make Post Tropical a stunner start to finish. Fans of James Blake's Overgrown and Bon Iver's self-titled second album should find this appealing, but this stands apart from both those records. It's not only smart, it's honest, emotionally and musically. ~ Thom Jurek",

        "summary": "A producer/songwriter for hire who has worked with a growing bevy of left-of-center luminaries from Lily Allen to Marina & the Diamonds, Benjamin Garrett (aka Fryars) first gained public attention with his 2009 electronic pop-infused debut Dark Young Hearts. That album found him mixing a kind of '80s-does-'60s singer/songwriter psychedelia Ã  la XTC with an utterly contemporary, DJ-influenced approach to modern pop. Begun in 2010 and infamously delayed due to label restructuring, Fryars' sophomore full-length album, 2014's Power, is a similarly quirky but even more ambitious concept album built around the fictional sci-fi storyline of a scientist whose invention of a fake sun brings about a nuclear winter. Working with producer Luke Smith (Depeche Mode, Foals), Garrett has crafted an album that's more contemporary in feel than Dark Young Hearts, with an arid, shimmery layer of EDM- and R&B-infused studio Ã©lan. Nonetheless, Power once again finds Fryars delivering a balance of stylistic influences, from late-'60s Baroque psychedelia (\"Thing of Beauty\"), to '70s electro-disco (\"Cool Like Me\"), to '80s new romantic pop (\"Don't Make It Hard on Yourself\"). Imagine something along the lines of Taking Tiger Mountain-era Brian Eno crossed with Scott 3-era Scott Walker, all produced by Giorgio Moroder and you'll get a sense of the expansive sound Fryars achieves on Power. Similarly, \"Sequoia,\" with its poignant and summery Brian Wilson-meets-Daft Punk sound, registers as both timeless and cutting edge. Some of this disconnected, out-of-time quality comes from Garrett's tendency to veil his already introspective baritone and lilting falsetto in the warm, electric gauze of a studio filter. It's almost as if aliens kidnapped ELO's Jeff Lynne and made him record an album at the furthest reaches of space and then beam it down to Earth. All of which is to say that with Power, Fryars has made an album that is cinematic, endlessly listenable and out of this world good. ~ Matt Collar",

        "summary": "Guitarist Ryley Walker follows All Kinds of You, his 2014 debut full-length, by delving deeper into some of the abstract jazz and psych-inflected folk-rock that permeated several of its tracks. On Primrose Green -- his debut for Dead Oceans -- he doesn't worry about putting his own signature on his tunes; this record is all about playing music he loves with people he respects. Though these are original songs, their inspirational roots lie in late-'60s and early-'70s sources. He's found a host of willing Chicago collaborators from the worlds of jazz and improv to assist, including cellists Fred Lonberg-Holm and Whitney Johnson, vibraphonist Jason Adasiewicz, drummer Frank Rosaly, keyboardist Ben Boye, upright and electric bassist Anton Hatwich, and electric guitarist Brian Sulpizio. Less than a minute into the opening title track, one can hear the very spirit of Tim Buckley -- one of several Walker muses here -- coming through the ether (or smoke, such as it were, since it is titled for a particular strain of pot). Eastern modes and droning psych are rung out on a 12-string, piano, electric guitars, vibes, and upright bass (the latter recalling Danny Thompson, who played with Buckley on the London concert issued as Dream Letter). Walker's voice swoops and sails, floats and hovers through his words about getting high. \"Summer Dress\" moves on (a bit) to widen the circle and embrace John Martyn's early-'70s sound inside Buckley's elastic chamber jazz approach. Sulpizio's guitar and Adasiewicz's vibes send this one into a darkly grooving stratosphere. \"Same Minds\" is so silvery and mercurial, one can feel Martyn's ghost in the mix. The instrumental \"Love Can Be Cruel\" evokes Brian Auger's sense of space and motion with wafting electronic noise grounding the tune in the 21st century. Speaking of Auger, the twilit psych-jazz of \"Sweet Satisfaction\" recalls the keyboardist's Trinity band with singer Julie Driscoll (now Tippetts), though Buckley's sense of elongated glossolalia still holds sway over the singer's vocal. Walker's killer fingerstyle guitar artistry isn't left off this record; it's present to stellar effect on \"Griffiths Bucks Blues,\" \"On the Banks of the Old Kishwaukee,\" \"The High Road\" (a duet with Lonberg-Holm), and the closing \"Hide in the Roses.\" The latter track is informed by Bert Jansch's and Davy Graham's readings of the British Isles folk tradition. It's these rootsier tunes that add glue to the sensual, stoned, free-spirited cuts to make this a cohesive album. With its ready absorption of, homage to, and engagement with the past, Walker's skills as a guitarist and arranger make Primrose Green as musically compelling as it is willfully indulgent. ~ Thom Jurek",

        "summary": "Signed to a major label at an early age, she was groomed in the darkness of studios, the label knowing the potential they had in their singer/songwriter. She wrote on her own, then she was paired with a sympathetic producer/songwriter, live performances taking a back seat to woodshedding. If this story in the early years of the 2010s brings to mind Lana Del Rey, it's no coincidence that it also applies to New Zealand singer/songwriter Lorde, whose 2013 debut, Pure Heroine, contains all of the stylized goth foreboding of LDR's Born to Die and almost none of the louche, languid glamour. This is not a small thing. Lana Del Rey is a self-created starlet willing herself into stardom but Lorde fancies herself a poet, churning away at the darker recesses of her soul. Some of this may be due to age. Lorde, as any pre-release review or portrait helpfully illustrated, was only 16 when she wrote and recorded Pure Heroine with producer Joel Little, and an adolescent aggrievance and angst certainly underpin the songs here. Lorde favors a tragic romanticism, an all-or-nothing melodrama that Little accentuates with his alternately moody and insistent productions. Where Lana Del Rey favors a studiously detached irony, Lorde pours it all out which, in itself, may be an act: her bedsit poetry is superficially more authentic but the music is certainly more pop, both in its construction -- there are big hooks in the choruses and verses -- and in the production, which accentuates a sad shimmer where everything is beautiful and broken. There is a topical appeal here, particularly because Lorde and Little do spend so much time on the surface, turning it into something seductive, but it is no more real than the studied detachment of Lana Del Rey, who Lorde so strongly (and intentionally) resembles. Born to Die is meant to be appreciated as slippery, elusive pop; Pure Heroine seems to hint at the truth...but the truth is, Lorde is a pop invention as much as LDR and is not nearly as honest about her intentions. [Pure Heroine was also released on LP.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Quartz Bijou is the truncated, single-disc version of the 2014 double album (simply called Quartz) by Nashville psych-rock combo Fly Golden Eagle. The brainchild of former Detroiter Ben Trimble, the band became a significant player in Nashville's indie underground scene with the release of its 2011 debut Swagger. Trimble's devotion to garage and funk-influenced psychedelia further manifested itself as the group set up shop in an abandoned college in Texas to record what would end up being an album inspired by Alejandro Jodorowsky's 1973, Beatles-supported avant-garde film The Holy Mountain. The full two-hour version of Quartz is, in fact, meant to be played alongside the film. Haven't seen The Holy Mountain? You're not alone and, fortunately, it's not a prerequisite for absorbing or enjoying Quartz Bijou. Obscurist tendencies aside, Fly Golden Eagle do manage to deliver some entertaining '60s and '70s-influenced rock, stacked with horns, chirping organs, a meaty rhythm section, and all manner of Nuggets-worthy guitar tones. Comparisons to ATO labelmates the Alabama Shakes are apt as the two bands have frequently toured and collaborated together. Elements of Detroit garage surface as well, especially on the White Stripes-esque thump of \"Stepping Stone.\" Stand-out cuts like the groovy \"Magic Steven\" and \"Medicine Hat\" show a band with plenty of creative spirit, but as a whole, Quartz Bijou struggles to distance itself from either its influences or the multitude of other bands dishing out similarly vintage-sounding neo-psychedelia in the indie rock world. Nevertheless, the songs here are generally fun, the playing solid, and the production appropriately trippy. [Quartz Bijou was also released on LP.] ~ Timothy Monger",

        "summary": "For The Reason, those nice suburban Californians in Hoobastank refine and shade in the concentric circles of their self-titled debut, but stay safely within its platinum figure eight. \"Crawling in the Dark\" was the contoured heart of that album. Its combination of enormous rock chorus and elastic dreamboat vocals made Hoobastank stars and established their sound -- not original, but firmly rooted in the rousing voice of Doug Robb and guitarist Dan Estrin's slick post-grunge concoctions. Despite the usual pressure to produce another \"Crawling,\" the songwriting duo seems to have largely been left alone for The Reason. Naturally, the presence of boffo big producer Howard Benson ensures the album's impeccable sonic accessibility. Robb's voice breaks at just the right time and for maximum emotional resonance, while the music ebbs and flows effortlessly between aggressive rockers and more introspective material. But for the most part, what you hear is what you get. Strings do pop up on a few songs, and here and there the harmonies seem too rich for reality. But these additional elements never overshadow the foursome's work. The strings punch up \"Lucky\"'s already uplifting chorus (the acoustic verses are a nice touch, too), while they're a lush bed of down pillows for the somewhat sappy title track. It's not that Robb's words throughout The Reason aren't genuine. Lyrics like \"I'm not a perfect person, I never meant to do those things to you,\" \"So what should I do, just lay next to you as though I'm unaffected?,\" and \"There has to be somewhere that we can be safe from the lives we live each day\" are delivered with real feeling. However, Hoobastank is still reducing teen angst (over love, escape, or a higher power) to digestible phrases, and writing sandpaper smooth rock symphonies around those couplets. So it's a formula, and one that remains unchanged from the debut. But Robb, Estrin, bassist Markku Lappalainen, and drummer Chris Hesse are a better band now -- endless touring will do that. \"Same Direction\" and \"Just One\" are standout anthems, raucous and righteous all at once. Lead single \"Out of Control\" lets Robb and Estrin shriek and shred with some reckless (yet still melodic and ready for radio) aggression. Meanwhile, the other, softer side of the band is represented best by \"What Happened to Us?\" and the drifting departure \"Disappear,\" which both unfold as much more focused versions of Hoobastank's sometimes clunky attempts at nuance (think \"To Be With You\"). In the end, The Reason is really a better version of Hoobastank, written and played by more mature versions of Hoobastank. ~ Johnny Loftus",

        "summary": "Like English-language rock, the rock en espaÃ±ol field has its superstars and its more underground artists. Superstars like los Fabulosos Cadillacs and Shakira can easily fill a huge soccer stadium in Mexico City or Buenos Aires, while the more underground artists perform in Latin America's small clubs. ManÃ¡ falls into the supergroup category; in Latin America, the Mexican outfit is as huge as Creed or Pearl Jam. And like other bands who are enormously successful, ManÃ¡ has their share of detractors. ManÃ¡'s detractors criticize the band for being slick and highly polished, and RevoluciÃ³n de Amor is unlikely to change that perception. There is, to be sure, a certain amount of slickness and arena rock gloss on this 2002 release. But there is also an impressive amount of craftsmanship; in fact, RevoluciÃ³n de Amor boasts some of ManÃ¡'s strongest writing. This time, ManÃ¡'s writing is quite consistent -- the band has recorded some uneven albums, but RevoluciÃ³n de Amor isn't one of them. All of the songs are extremely listenable, and that is true whether ManÃ¡ incorporates Mexican elements on \"Mariposa Traicionera\" or gets into a salsa-influenced groove on \"No Voy A Ser Tu Esclavo\" and \"Sabanas FrÃ­as.\" For all of their pop gloss, ManÃ¡ can be challenging -- both musically and lyrically. Musically, ManÃ¡ uses a variety of influences to their creative advantage -- everything from salsa to reggae to North African music -- and the lyrics address both sociopolitical and romantic concerns. RevoluciÃ³n de Amor is unlikely to convert anyone who has been critical of ManÃ¡'s work in the past, but those who have had a generally favorable view of the band will find this CD to be among the Mexican rockers' strongest, most consistent efforts. ~ Alex Henderson",

Although Newman made this album with a new set of collaborators, including fellow producer/songwriters Greg Kurstin and Jack Splash, its foundation is likewise in muscular retro-soul that blares and bolts and manages to keep up with the singer's superhuman level of energy. There are lighter diversions into house and disco -- including \"Tiring Game,\" featuring Charlie Wilson -- and Newman dials it down every now and then for ballads, but Revolve is very much in line with the winning formula of Tribute. Its wider emotional range and stylistic switch-ups, none of which is outside Newman's grasp, give it a slight edge. [A Deluxe Edition was also released.] ~ Andy Kellman",

        "summary": "Even more similar to its predecessor, The Mirror Conspiracy, than that one was to the first Thievery Corporation LP, The Richest Man in Babylon provides some beat-heavy, languorous excursions into territory long-favored by Thievery Corporation -- namely, the music of Brazil, India, and Jamaica -- but doesn't have the hooks or the production finesse to compete with The Mirror Conspiracy. On the opener, \"Heaven's Gonna Burn Your Eyes,\" guest Emiliana Torrini treasures her vocals endearingly, but the backing could've been taken wholesale from any of a dozen Thievery productions (or perhaps Air's Moon Safari). \"The Outernationalist,\" a bass-heavy trip into ambient-dub headspace, sounds great too, but it also occupies the same territory as a previous track (2000's \"Treasure\"). Vocalists LouLou and Pam Bricker both return for two features each, practically indistinguishable from their previous tracks. (Of course, it's difficult to resist a bland sound when the bassline for an entire song, \"Un Simple Histoire (A Simple Story),\" encompasses only four different notes and continues throughout.) Fortunately, a few tracks on the backside do plow new ground, thanks in part to new guests: \"Meu Destino (My Destiny),\" with the ephemeral falsetto of Patrick de Santos; \"Exilio (Exile),\" which introduces Afro-Cuban percussion into the Thievery template; and a great feature for Shinehead on \"The State of the Union,\" while Garza and Hilton throw in a few extra beats (for once). Admittedly, a solid set of treading-water productions is vastly preferred to a bad album, especially on the dancefloor. Sure, it could've been worse, but it also could've been slightly different.

        "summary": "Herb Alpert occupies a unique niche in the music scene. His techno-pop productions fall outside commonly accepted notions of jazz, yet there's little in the realm of pop music with which to compare them. His trumpet work is sonorous and evocative. His compositions are infused with Latin and European tempos and strains, all the while appealing to contemporary R&B, rock, and electronic dance music audiences.\r\n\r\nThe title track is particularly effective, with Alpert's moody and sexy trumpet accompanied by a soulful back up of guitars, keyboard, and bass. The violins and electronic beat of \"Behind the Rain\" add a touch of discotheque drama, but the real pleasure comes from Alpert's trumpet and the electric guitar highlights. The production values are obvious. These tracks have a street feel in their heavy beat, and in their sensually complex orchestrations and rhythms.",

        "summary": "Borrowing heavily from Marc Bolan's glam rock and the future shock of A Clockwork Orange, David Bowie reached back to the heavy rock of The Man Who Sold the World for The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Constructed as a loose concept album about an androgynous alien rock star named Ziggy Stardust, the story falls apart quickly, yet Bowie's fractured, paranoid lyrics are evocative of a decadent, decaying future, and the music echoes an apocalyptic, nuclear dread. Fleshing out the off-kilter metallic mix with fatter guitars, genuine pop songs, string sections, keyboards, and a cinematic flourish, Ziggy Stardust is a glitzy array of riffs, hooks, melodrama, and style and the logical culmination of glam. Mick Ronson plays with a maverick flair that invigorates rockers like \"Suffragette City,\" \"Moonage Daydream,\" and \"Hang Onto Yourself,\" while \"Lady Stardust,\" \"Five Years,\" and \"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide\" have a grand sense of staged drama previously unheard of in rock & roll. And that self-conscious sense of theater is part of the reason why Ziggy Stardust sounds so foreign. Bowie succeeds not in spite of his pretensions but because of them, and Ziggy Stardust -- familiar in structure, but alien in performance -- is the first time his vision and execution met in such a grand, sweeping fashion. [The Rise and Fall was re-released on LP in 2016.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "At its best, the Romantics' self-titled debut album sounds like the greatest album Shel Talmy never produced. The Detroit band's British Invasion-style power pop may not have been an especially original creation, but it was good enough that no one with a taste for high-voltage hooks would ever dream of complaining, and as a meeting of mid-'60s style and late-'70s volume and passion, it's all but flawless. The original songs, written by guitarists Wally Palmar and Mike Skill and drummer Jimmy Marinos, are a glorious pastiche of period pop styles (think the Kinks and the Easybeats with a bit of the Hollies thrown in for melodic appeal) played with a hard-stomping energy and a genuine love for the vintage style that doesn't reek of nostalgia. The production by Peter Solley is simple but smart enough to put both the hooks at the energy up front where they belong, and the Romantics never had a set of tunes this strong again; \"What I Like About You\" richly deserved its status as a hit single, and \"When I Look in Your Eyes,\" \"Tell It to Carrie\" and \"Girl Next Door\" would have followed it up the charts in a just world. the Romantics didn't exactly reinvent the wheel with this album, but they sure knew how to make it roll, and for sheer party enhancing energy, this album is hard to beat. [A remastered, limited edition CD was released in 2012.] ~ Mark Deming",

From the sneakily addictive, new wave-tinged \"12:51\" to \"Automatic Stop\"'s loping reggae beat to \"Under Control\"'s '60s soul homage, the band explores sounds never dreamed of on their debut. Though the Strokes recapture some of Is This It's exuberance on \"You Talk Way Too Much\" and \"Meet Me in the Bathroom,\" songs like \"The End Has No End,\" which repeats its title in a surprisingly affecting way, are the most memorable. Room on Fire shows that even after all that happened to the Strokes, they can still surprise. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "Rumours is the kind of album that transcends its origins and reputation, entering the realm of legend -- it's an album that simply exists outside of criticism and outside of its time, even if it thoroughly captures its era. Prior to this LP, Fleetwood Mac were moderately successful, but here they turned into a full-fledged phenomenon, with Rumours becoming the biggest-selling pop album to date. While its chart success was historic, much of the legend surrounding the record is born from the group's internal turmoil. Unlike most bands, Fleetwood Mac in the mid-'70s were professionally and romantically intertwined, with no less than two couples in the band, but as their professional career took off, the personal side unraveled. Bassist John McVie and his keyboardist/singer wife Christine McVie filed for divorce as guitarist/vocalist Lindsey Buckingham and vocalist Stevie Nicks split, with Stevie running to drummer Mick Fleetwood, unbeknown to the rest of the band. These personal tensions fueled nearly every song on Rumours, which makes listening to the album a nearly voyeuristic experience. You're eavesdropping on the bandmates singing painful truths about each other, spreading nasty lies and rumors and wallowing in their grief, all in the presence of the person who caused the heartache. Everybody loves gawking at a good public breakup, but if that was all that it took to sell a record, Richard and Linda Thompson's Shoot Out the Lights would be multi-platinum. No, what made Rumours an unparalleled blockbuster is the quality of the music. Once again masterminded by producer/songwriter/guitarist Buckingham, Rumours is an exceptionally musical piece of work -- he toughens Christine McVie and softens Nicks, adding weird turns to accessibly melodic works, which gives the universal themes of the songs haunting resonance. It also cloaks the raw emotion of the lyrics in deceptively palatable arrangements that made a tune as wrecked and tortured as \"Go Your Own Way\" an anthemic hit. But that's what makes Rumours such an enduring achievement -- it turns private pain into something universal. Some of these songs may be too familiar, whether through their repeated exposure on FM radio or their use in presidential campaigns, but in the context of the album, each tune, each phrase regains its raw, immediate emotional power -- which is why Rumours touched a nerve upon its 1977 release, and has since transcended its era to be one of the greatest, most compelling pop albums of all time.

        "summary": "Bursting with youthful passion, California's Run River North create a lush and soothing world on their self-titled debut album. Since forming in 2011, the six-member ensemble from the San Fernando Valley has diligently honed their brand of heartfelt, orchestral indie pop on-stage and at home, and they've even filmed a video of themselves recording tracks in their cars. With their folky, anthemic sound and warm harmonies, comparisons to similarly minded bands like Of Monsters and Men and The Head and the Heart are apt, although even at their most serious, they still exude a sort of laid-back West Coast charm that could only come from kids who grew up in the Valley. Working with producer Phil Ek, whose credits include other throaty troubadours like Fleet Foxes and Band of Horses, the group has laid a sturdy foundation of well-written acoustic pop with songs like \"Monsters Calling Home,\" \"Fight to Keep,\" and the buoyant rocker \"Excuses.\" Their music is rich and expansive and the songs often deal with broad themes of emotional and spiritual struggle like on \"Beetle\" and \"Somewhere.\" Still, with all their questioning, they usually seem to come out on top with a calm sort of gracefulness, packaging their dark themes of soul-searching into a more hopeful and comforting package. This type of earnest, introspective folk-pop isn't necessarily groundbreaking, but Run River North do their version of it well, emanating a friendliness that is easy to get behind. They largely avoid the rootsy cliches of the waning new folk movement, identifying more with the chamber pop side of the spectrum on this promising debut. [Run River North was also released on vinyl.] ~ Timothy Monger",

Centered on the talents of singer/songwriter Clemens Rehbein and DJ Philipp Dausch, Milky Chance make quirky, atmospheric songs that touch upon such genres as folk, reggae, and electronica. A self-produced album, Sadnecessary strikes a pleasing balance between lo-fi introspection, arty experimentation, and melodic lyricism. Included here are such songs as \"Stolen Dance,\" \"Down by the River,\" and \"Flashed Junk Mind.\" [Sadnecessary was also released with two bonus tracks: \"Feathery\" and \"Loveland.\"] ~ Matt Collar",

        "summary": "With his 2012 debut, 2, Canadian songwriter Mac DeMarco offered the world a look into his dazed but brilliant mind's eye, his songs landing somewhere between a hallucinogenic re-imagination of '70s soft rock, oddball outsider jams, and laid-back indie fare. The tunes were somehow both tuneful and antagonistic in the subtlest of ways, and DeMarco easily shifted between characters of the stoned joker and sincere balladeer, playing each remarkably convincingly. Salad Days picks up where the strange vibes of 2 left off, brightening the production and shying away from Mac's more insane impulses for a clearer picture of his immensely cracked idea of what pop music is. By this point, DeMarco's guitar sound is becoming one of his signatures. Mellow, snaking, busy lines of chorus-drenched leads intertwine and chime over the top of thoughtful, sometimes restrained chords. This guitar work shows up at its most melodic on tracks like \"Let Her Go\" and the standout \"Blue Boy,\" and appears in a more jagged form on mellow rockers like \"Goodbye Weekend.\" DeMarco has his feet in a bevy of styles on Salad Days without coming off scattered, including the brittle '80s R&B synths of \"Chamber of Reflection\" and the channeling of songwriting greats like John Lennon and Ray Davies elsewhere. The title track goes so far as to sport some \"la la la\"s that could have been lifted directly off The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society. Absent from this album are both the highly contrasting moments of dreamy-eyed indie rock and wobbly, Ween-indebted weirdness that came through more sharply on 2. With songs touching on themes of maturation, life in the public eye, and good old-fashioned romance, DeMarco has trimmed the fat both musically and conceptually on Salad Days, turning in a streamlined picture of his musical development. With more memorable tracks and a slightly more accessible feel, the album is less distracted and more tuneful than before without losing any of the freewheeling spirit that made his songs and persona so attractive in the first place. [Salad Days was also released on LP.] ~ Fred Thomas",

        "summary": "The notion that time heals all wounds is ultimately false, but the passage of a few years does make the pain less vivid, which is borne out on the Rosebuds' sixth album, Sand+Silence. Released in 2011, Loud Planes Fly Low was recorded in the wake of the divorce of the group's founders, Ivan Howard and Kelly Crisp, and it wasn't hard to hear the tension and heartbreak lurking in the songs. Three years later, the Rosebuds sound a bit dour, as they so often do, but the edge of disappointment has faded, and a faint hope has returned on Sand+Silence's 11 songs. Howard's friend and occasional collaborator Justin Vernon (of Bon Iver) co-produced the album (with BJ Burton) as well as handling guitars, keyboards, and percussion, and while he might seem like a curious choice to bring a breezy pop sound to numbers like \"Mine Mine Mine\" or \"Death of an Old Bike,\" the results sound playful and freewheeling, but rich and full of smart details that reveal themselves on repeated plays, while \"In My Teeth,\" \"Tiny Bones,\" and the title cut reflect the more downbeat chamber pop approach that's been the Rosebuds' stock in trade since their sophomore effort, 2005's Birds Make Good Neighbors. Though Howard and Crisp are in good (well, clearly better) spirits on Sand+Silence, it's worth noting that she seems to be a somewhat muted presence on these sessions; she helped write all the songs, but her contributions in the studio are limited to piano and harmony vocals, while Howard handles all the lead vocals (sounding strong and emotionally eloquent) as well as various guitars and keyboards, and four other musicians are on hand to fill out the subtle but sometimes dense arrangements. However the principals have made their compromises, Sand+Silence shows Howard and Crisp are committed to keeping this band alive, and the album confirms they're still an uncommonly smart and talented indie pop band with a great deal to offer. ~ Mark Deming",

        "summary": "Before the arrival of Carlos Santana's eponymous band, the San Francisco rock scene drew the inspiration for its jam-oriented music mainly from blues, rock, and Eastern modalities. Santana added Latin music to the mix, forever changing the course of rock & roll history. On their groundbreaking debut album, the group mix Latin percussion with driving rock grooves. Santana's unique guitar style, alternately biting and liquid, vies with the multiple percussionists for the sonic focus.\r\nUnlike later efforts, Santana's first album features an abundance of loose, collective compositions based on a couple of simple riffs (\"Jingo,\" \"Soul Sacrifice\"). This approach allows for Santana and his bandmates to flex their improvisational muscles to fine effect. The high-energy level on Santana is infectious -- the laid-back feel of other '60s San Francisco groups was clearly not for Carlos and co. ~ [Santana was re-released on LP in 2015.] ~ Rovi Staff",

        "summary": "For Portugal. The Man's sixth release in only four years, The Satanic Satanist, the band tones down the progressive leanings demonstrated on Church Mouth, and instead, goes for a straight forward, pop approach. With no song extending much longer than four minutes, John Gourley's bright falsetto matches up with breezy harmonies in a Band of Horses/ My Morning Jacket way while the synthesized instrumentation takes a page from MGMT. The slick electro direction is a pleasant change, although it may be a little disconcerting to fans who appreciate the more indulgent side of PTM. For The Satanic Satanist, they walk away from the playgrounds of their past (which included emo, art-folk, and indie rock) and try their hand at chamber pop by filtering their music through a reverby wash, embracing electronica, and elaborately layering stacks of tracks. Reputed producer Paul Q. Kolderie (Radiohead, Belly, Lemonheads) gives the sound a crystal sparkle, which, paired with the mellow vibe of the album, makes The Satanic Satanist one of the groups' most accessible and easily digestible to date.

        "parentKey": "/library/metadata/1",
        "parentTitle": "Various Artists",
        "summary": "Every so often, a piece of music comes along that defines a moment in popular culture history: Johann Strauss' operetta Die Fledermaus did this in Vienna in the 1870s; Jerome Kern's Show Boat did it for Broadway musicals of the 1920s, and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album served this purpose for the era of psychedelic music in the 1960s. Saturday Night Fever, although hardly as prodigious an artistic achievement as those precursors, was precisely that kind of musical phenomenon for the second half of the '70s. Ironically, before its release, the disco boom had seemingly run its course, primarily in Europe, and was confined mostly to black culture and the gay underground in America. Saturday Night Fever, as a movie and an album, plus a brace of hit singles off of it, suddenly made disco explode into mainstream, working- and middle-class America with a new immediacy and urgency, increasing its audience ten-fold overnight. The Bee Gees had written \"Stayin' Alive\" (then called \"Saturday Night\"), \"Night Fever,\" \"How Deep Is Your Love,\" \"If I Can't Have You,\" and \"More Than a Woman\" for what would have been the follow-up album to Children of the World, and they might well have enjoyed platinum-record status with that proposed album. Instead, Robert Stigwood asked them in early 1977 to contribute songs to the soundtrack of a movie that he was financing, a low-budget picture called \"Tribal Rites on a Saturday Night.\" More out of loyalty to him than any belief in the viability of the film, they obliged. The group's involvement even survived the decision by the original director, John Avildsen, that he didn't want their music in the film. Instead, Stigwood fired him and brought in the very talented but much more agreeable John Badham, the movie's title was changed to Saturday Night Fever, the Bee Gees' music stayed, and the result was the biggest-selling soundtrack album in history, a 25-million copy monster whose sales, even as a more expensive double-LP, dwarfed the multi-million units sold of Children of the World and Main Course. Strangely enough, for all of the fixation of the movie and its audience on dancing, the Bee Gees' new songs were weighted equally toward ethereal ballads, which may be one reason for the soundtrack album's appeal -- it delivers what its audience expects, plus a \"bonus\" in the form of the soaring, lyrical romantic numbers that were, as with most ventures by the Gibb Brothers in this area, virtually irresistible. Despite the presence of other artists, Saturday Night Fever is virtually indispensable as a Bee Gees album, not just for the presence of an array of songs that were hits in their own right -- and which became the de facto soundtrack to a half-decade of pop culture history -- but because it offered the Gibb Brothers as composers as well as artists, with their work recorded by Yvonne Elliman (\"If I Can't Have You\"), and Tavares (\"More Than a Woman\"), and it placed their music alongside the work of Kool & the Gang and MFSB. In essence, the layout of the soundtrack was the culmination of everything they'd been moving toward since the Mr. Natural album. Even the presence of David Shire's \"Night on Disco Mountain\" and \"Salsation,\" and Walter Murphy's \"A Fifth of Beethoven,\" don't hurt, because these set a mood and a surrounding ambience for the Bee Gees' material that makes it work even better. ~ Bruce Eder",

        "summary": "Like fellow Frenchmen Air and Daft Punk, M83's Anthony Gonzalez has the knack for making sounds others might think of as outdated, or even tacky, into music that feels stylish and fresh. Saturdays=Youth lives up to its evocative title, but the youth it captures is filtered through nostalgia for the unrepentantly fake sounds of the '80s, transforming them into delicate fantasy pop. Synths whoosh like wind tunnels and ping like lasers, guitars are whipped into ethereal froth, the drums are robotic and proud of it, and the production reproduces the cleaner-than-clean, almost brittle style of the era almost too perfectly. The largely instrumental \"Couleurs\" races through the night on synth and drum swells that haven't been heard since Miami Vice's heyday, while \"Skin of the Night\" sounds like it borrows Phil Collins' kit from No Jacket Required. Though Saturdays=Youth often plays like a love letter to artists ranging from the Cocteau Twins to Mr. Mister, it never seems like an exercise designed to just re-create those sounds. The cinematic feel of Before the Dawn Heals Us is stronger than ever here, from the 11-minute finale \"Midnight Souls Still Remain,\" which unfolds like closing credits, to the Breakfast Club-meets-fashion shoot album cover, which makes Saturdays=Youth appear to be the soundtrack to the most glamorous film John Hughes never made. This hyper-stylized teen romance and angst drive the album, taking it to the highest highs and the lowest lows. \"We Own the Sky\" is jubilant, stretching out into a summery haze of airy vocals and synths; \"Too Late\" contemplates the end in melodramatic, ultra-romantic fashion, ending with a whispered \"you, always.\" Saturdays=Youth also features some of M83's purest pop yet, which provide many of the album's standouts. \"Kim & Jessie\" heart-racing young love is one of Gonzalez's finest sonic confections, along with \"Graveyard Girl\" and the Kate Bush-worshiping \"Up!,\" a sci-fi fairy tale that boasts some fittingly unearthly singing by guest vocalist Morgan Kibby. As super-stylized as its sounds and emotions are, Saturdays=Youth always seems genuine, even when it feels like its songs are made from the memories of other songs. For all of its nostalgic haze, it's some of M83's most focused music. [Saturdays = Youth was also released on LP.] ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "Boise, Idaho-based D.I.Y. singer/songwriter Trevor Powers steps outside, geographically speaking, for the first time on his third studio long-player, the stark, soulful, and often strident Savage Hills Ballroom. Recorded in Bristol, England with producer Ali Chant (Perfume Genius, Giant Sand, Gravenhurst), who wisely removes the safety net of cumbrous vocal reverb that has served as the vessel with which Powers has been delivering his falsetto-led laments to the myriad pains of youth since his 2011 debut, the ten-track set is Youth Lagoon's most cohesive and mesmerizing to date. Powers' distinctive voice, a reedy, untamed amalgam of Flaming Lips frontman Wayne Coyne and Danielson Famile patriarch Daniel Smith, is left mostly untouched effects-wise throughout, and that sonic austerity lends an air of immediacy to the proceedings that has eluded prior outings. Opener \"Officer Telephone\" treads familiar ground initially, pairing Powers' cryptic prose with a simple keyboard chord progression and a distant hi-hat, but a propulsive midsection yields a surprisingly breakbeat-heavy finale. Elsewhere, the languid \"Highway Patrol Stun Gun\" impresses with its pure melancholy sunset pop acumen, the meaty single \"The Knower\" finds Powers boldly wrestling with the dualities of the social media shame/validation cycle, and the soaring \"Rotten Human,\" a hook-filled, pugilistic blast of hard truths and cruel ironies, finds him at his most vocally commanding and affecting. With Savage Hills Ballroom Powers has expanded the Youth Lagoon sound without losing any of the intimacy of his bedroom pop beginnings. He's still transmitting directly from the vagus nerve, and the anxiety behind each track is palpable, but it's madness delivered with a confectioner's touch. ~ James Christopher Monger",

A loose concept album about lost innocence and the crumbling of small-town America, Scarecrow says as much with its tough rock and gentle folk-rock as it does with its lyrics, which remain a weak point for Mellencamp. Nevertheless, his writing has never been more powerful: \"Rain on the Scarecrow\" and \"Small Town\" capture the hopes and fears of Middle America, while \"Lonely Ol' Night\" and \"Rumbleseat\" effortlessly convey the desperate loneliness of being stuck in a dead-end life. Those four songs form the core of the album, and while the rest of the album isn't quite as strong, that's only a relative term, since it's filled with lean hooks and powerful, economical playing that make Scarecrow one of the definitive blue-collar rock albums of the mid-'80s. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

Whatever bonus material attached to CD reissues over the years has been stripped away -- nothing from the 2001 deluxe edition of Billion Dollar Babies, then -- and there are no new remasters of the albums, but this set isn't bare bones. The mini-LP replicas contain a few inserts carried over from the vinyl and, more importantly, those early Straight Records are present, which is good because they were out of print for a while. Not everything here is great  -- he did have a rough patch in the late '70s and early '80s -- but it's all interesting, and it's especially nice to be able to get the entire catalog so easily and cheaply. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Lynyrd Skynyrd wrote the book on Southern rock with their first album, so it only made sense that they followed it for their second album, aptly titled Second Helping. Sticking with producer Al Kooper (who, after all, discovered them), the group turned out a record that replicated all the strengths of the original, but was a little tighter and a little more professional. It also revealed that the band, under the direction of songwriter Ronnie Van Zant, was developing a truly original voice. Of course, the band had already developed their own musical voice, but it was enhanced considerably by Van Zant's writing, which was at turns plainly poetic, surprisingly clever, and always revealing. Though Second Helping isn't as hard a rock record as Pronounced, it's the songs that make the record. \"Sweet Home Alabama\" became ubiquitous, yet it's rivaled by such terrific songs as the snide, punkish \"Workin' for MCA,\" the Southern groove of \"Don't Ask Me No Questions,\" the affecting \"The Ballad of Curtis Loew,\" and \"The Needle and the Spoon,\" a drug tale as affecting as their rival Neil Young's \"Needle and the Damage Done,\" but much harder rocking. This is the part of Skynyrd that most people forget -- they were a great band, but they were indelible because that was married to great writing. And nowhere was that more evident than on Second Helping. [Second Helping was re-released on LP in 2015.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

Featuring songs from Of Monsters and Men, Rogue Wave, and Bahamas, the collection has a sweeping vibe to it that's hard not to get carried away by, packing the album with songs that are easy to love and even easier to get lost in. ~ Gregory Heaney",

And listeners expecting something special from an unknown granted a licensing to the quality-control experts at Warp won't be disappointed by Seed to Sun; it's experimental hip-hop being done on a level reached by few producers out there. More experimental, rangier, and lighter than any Co-Flow material, but more producer-driven than Kid Koala's records, the album encompasses analog electronics, beat-heavy experimental techno, turntablist scratching, and dozens of mostly unrecognizable samples (one strain that briefly emerges from the soup: B.J. Thomas' \"Everybody's Out of Town\"). Surprisingly, Seed to Sun is also very melodic, audible even when Boom Bip layers dense beats and samples over his tracks, as on \"Closed Shoulders.\" For \"The Unthinkable,\" one of the few vocal tracks, guest Buck 65 comes off like a countrified rapper produced by El-P. The other top-notch vocal comes from Dose One (from Anticon), prefacing a Cypress Hill-goes-pop chorus on \"Mannequin Hand Trapdoor I Reminder\" with some paranoid musings. Nothing against El-P; he's a great producer, and deserves most of the hype he's gotten. It's just that Seed to Sun does what he does so much better. ~ John Bush",

        "summary": "Arriving three years after the mellow Nine Types of Light -- and the death of bassist Gerard Smith, who succumbed to lung cancer just days after the album's release -- Seeds has a palpable sense of moving on for TV on the Radio. Sonically, it's crisper and clearer than ever before; songs like the beautiful ballad \"Test Pilot\" use this clarity to prove, once again, that TV on the Radio fuse indie and R&B more genuinely than many of the acts that sprang up during their hiatus. Though they rein in their trademark lushness ever so slightly, it doesn't diminish their sound's magnitude; instead, it adds an urgency that feels even more pointed after Nine Types' hazy reveries. Similarly, that album's philosophical tone continues on Seeds, with the band confronting loss directly on the album's first half and accepting it on the second. TV on the Radio are often at their most compelling when they're grappling with something, and album opener \"Quartz\" -- on which Tunde Adebimpe asks \"How hard must we try?\" -- showcases them in all their frustrated glory. Likewise, that songs as emotionally opposed as \"Could You,\" where Kyp Malone wonders about being able to love again, and \"Happy Idiot,\" where Adebimpe willfully numbs himself to the pain, are both triumphs is another testament to the band's complexity. Seeds' first half is so strong that it's not surprising that it sags by comparison a little later. To be fair, it's harder to write uplifting and empowering songs that don't sound trite, and TV on the Radio manage more than a few: the anthemic \"Ride,\" the fired-up \"Winter,\" and the furious rocker \"Lazerray\" all deliver far more than platitudes. Just when it feels like things might be too relentlessly positive, the band injects some welcome ambiguity into \"Trouble\"'s refrain of \"Everything's gonna be OK,\" letting it teeter between reassurance and uncertainty. By the time the title track closes the album with the promise of rebirth, TV on the Radio's reinvention as survivors is complete. At its best, Seeds is a fine tribute to Smith and the sound of enduring unimaginable loss. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "After completing the Both Ways Open Jaws tour, the DÃ¸ looked for a new creative path. Finding inspiration in the abstract electronics of Fuck Buttons and Kanye West's Yeezus, they emerged with Shake Shook Shaken, a set of songs trading kitchen sink experimentalism for sharp-edged electropop. It's a transformation for the better -- even though Mouthful and Both Ways Open Jaws had plenty of eclectic charms, the clearly defined aesthetic here allows them to concentrate on making pop that's addictively weird and catchy. The brightly bittersweet opener \"Keep Your Lips Sealed\" and the buzzing \"Going Through Walls\" recall the tart, hooky songs the Knife wrote before Silent Shout, while \"Despair, Hangover & Ecstacy\"'s sugar-coated melodrama calls to mind La Roux. The DÃ¸'s songwriting takes just as big a step forward as their sound, tackling the uncertainty of emotional fault lines and unwelcome but necessary change with vivid imagery and melodies. Olivia Merilahti's higher, slightly pained register suits turbulent songs such as \"A Mess Like This,\" where she sings \"You were the worst idea I ever had\" with equal amounts of frustration and affection, and \"Miracles (Back in Time),\" an elliptical recounting of heartache with sentiments that pierce like arrows. Things get even more complicated on \"Lick My Wounds,\" which teeters between joyous and bittersweet so often that it erases the line between them, while \"Anita, No!\" disguises its plea for closure in a pun. Though the album loses a little focus after its near-flawless first half, Shake Shook Shaken is the DÃ¸'s finest work yet and a pointed and poignant document of change and its aftermath. ~ Heather Phares",

        "parentTitle": "Timbaland",
        "summary": "\"2 Man Show,\" the epilogue of Timbaland Presents Shock Value, involves 24 men and women. The title refers to Timbaland and Elton John. John, despite being Elton John, doesn't sing on the song, but he does play some loose piano. Most of the vocals are left to Timbaland, who improvises with a nonstop series of directions, comments, and grunts. He participates in some nonchalant call-and-response singing as well. It's a relaxed way to close an exhausting album, and it's also an odd way to utilize Elton John and a 19-person choir. While the song is an extreme example, it does illustrate the inexplicable and intermittently unpredictable nature of an album that would be more accurately titled Timbaland Presents Slight Confusion or Timbaland Presents an Uneven Mess. \r\nThe reigning producer of R&B and rap since 1996, the year of Ginuwine's \"Pony\" and Aaliyah's \"If Your Girl Only Knew,\" Timbaland has amassed piles of ingenious and commercially successful releases. Due to his work on Nelly Furtado's \"Promiscuous\" and Justin Timberlake's \"SexyBack,\" two of the least-avoidable pop singles released in 2006, his profile has never been higher. Consequentially, there has never been more anticipation for one of his own albums. His three albums with sidekick Magoo, in addition to the solo-proper Tim's Bio, each had measurable amounts of hype around their release dates. A new level of visibility, combined with a lot of eclectic star power and a couple silly beefs, has turned Shock Value into a major release.\r\nIf you haven't read any interviews with Tim from the past few years, or if you missed some of the more telling hints, such as his work on Brandy's Coldplay-sampling \"Should I Go,\" there could be some shock involved while listening to the album for the first time. Although he has continued to contribute beats for MCs -- Young Jeezy's \"3 a.m.,\" Snoop Dogg's \"Get a Light,\" and Redman's \"Put It Down\" are a few recent examples -- Tim has frequently said that he is bored with rap and into rock, and here he takes the opportunity to reach beyond R&B, rap, and straight-up pop. \"Throw It on Me,\" with the Hives (a good-time garage rock band from Sweden), is a frisky, careening number that must have taken all of ten minutes to put together. A remix of \"Apologize,\" a ballad by OneRepublic (a band that might soundtrack the next season of Grey's Anatomy, or the imaginary annex between Abercrombie & Fitch and The Gap), incorporates an unobtrusive Timbaland beat and some distant vocal accents. With She Wants Revenge (a bad-time faux-British synth duo) and Fall Out Boy (you probably know about them), Tim is an interloper who takes part in songs that wouldn't be worse off without his presence. It's most jarring to hear him as a temporary member of the typically sullen She Wants Revenge, where his downcast verses give way to Justin Warfield's heavily affected drone.  \r\nThe four songs involving the rockers are the only ones that have the potential to shock, and they're bundled together during the last quarter of the album, so it's not as if they're even being emphasized. Otherwise, Shock Value is similar in setup to Diddy's certifiably flawed and maliciously (and/or unjustly) panned Press Play, a sprawling but often pleasurable album involving so many MCs, singers, and studio hands that a head count would rival that of the sessions for \"We Are the World.\" Tim, along with super-talented associates Danja and Keri Hilson, are some of the common links between the two albums, which share a similar balance between rap tracks heavy on mostly empty grandstanding, pop-R&B songs with male-female exchanges, and a couple club-oriented surprises that go outside the norms of modern rap and R&B. So, in a number of ways, Shock Value can be viewed a sister release to the Diddy album.\r\nLike Press Play, many of the album's key performances come from the females. Hilson, a songwriter, arranger, and singer who has also had a hand in Mary J. Blige's \"Take Me as I Am\" and Omarion's \"Ice Box,\" is central to three of the album's most memorable songs. \"Miscommunication\" is the greatest of the three, where she delivers one of the most advanced hooks of the last several years. She took pity on a pathetic fellow (played by a temporarily humble-ish Timbaland), was repaid with a stifling relationship that went too far, and comes up with a disarming way of saying \"You're killing me.\" A completely unnecessary ear-sore of a closing verse from Tim's brother Sebastian does little to harm its effect.\r\n\"Bounce,\" one of Tim's toughest and most sinister beats, is offset by comically over-the-top wordplay from Missy Elliott and Dr. Dre, along with an equally ridiculous appearance from Justin Timberlake (\"Like your ass had the hiccups/Like we was riding in my pickup\"). Missy outdoes the guys, entering with \"Hold up, hell naw/Like Britney Spears, I wear no draws.\" The rest of the verse is Missy at her lewd best, nothing new yet still 100 percent capable of keeping the testosterone level in check. Even though it's very possible that the involved recorded their parts in different studios, you can imagine them in fits of laughter while trying to top one another's outrageousness. The track is where the blast had by Tim and company, detectable throughout the majority of the album (a saving grace), is at its most contagious. \r\nWhen the album doesn't sound like a blast is being had, Tim's rhymes are usually within close proximity. They tend to leave a stale aftertaste. As with Jay-Z's Kingdom Come, listening to unrelatable boasts about extreme commercial and financial successes can get tiresome fast, especially when self-satisfaction wipes out any sense of hunger or passion. He brags about making half a million for a beat, and then, a few tracks later, the figure is a quarter of a million. Either he makes too much money to count, or his ghostwriters didn't compare notes. And while he is a competent enough MC to hang with the guest verses -- including low-wattage turns from 50 Cent and Tony Yayo, along with relatively engaging appearances from Attitude, D.O.E., and Magoo -- he's much more effective when restricting himself to incidental goading and singing that merely glides over the beat.\r\nBeyond the Elton John feature, the flat-out puzzling moments are limited, yet they certainly add to the album's lack of sturdiness. Bearing a heavy resemblance to Ciara's \"Promise,\" \"Fantasy\" was produced by Walter \"Lil' Walt\" Millsap with Boss Beats and bears no credit to Timbaland. It's also the only song on the album where vocals are provided by one person. \"Release,\" strangely placed third on the album -- just after lead single \"Give It to Me\" -- is a tossed-off house track, just as much of a Basement Jaxx rip as Basement Jaxx's own \"U Can't Stop Me\" (off 1999's Remedy) is a rip of Tim and Missy Elliott's earlier hits together.\r\nShock Value would be less of a hot-and-cold affair with a couple more songs in the vein of \"Give It to Me.\" A leisurely club track full of swagger, it is immediate enough to connect on the first listen, while Tim also sneaks in enough subtle layers to make it increasingly insidious with each play. This song isn't lacking bizarreness or complications, either. Furtado's words are benign enough, but it's evident that Timberlake is taking an ignorant shot at Prince, while Timbaland (despite claiming that he is not targeting one specific person) is most likely referring to one-man beat factory slash opportunist Scott Storch. These are two of the most pointless beefs in the history of pointless beefs, so the details needn't be recounted. It is worth noting, however, that \"Give It to Me\" provoked Storch to record a laughably inept response track. Regardless of Shock Value's missteps, Tim's track record says all that is necessary.

        "parentTitle": "Laura Marling",
        "summary": "Following in the dusty, sun-baked footsteps of 2013's mesmerizing Once I Was an Eagle, Laura Marling's fifth studio outing feels even more rooted in the California desert, doubling down on the former's penchant for pairing breezy, American west coast mysticism with bucolic, Sandy Denny-era English folk, but with a subtle shift in architecture. Marling's gift for gab and deft finger-picking are still front and center, but with the self-produced Short Movie, she's expanded her sonic palette by plugging in. While by no means a straight-up electric guitar album, Short Movie does bristle with a current of nervy energy, and that coffee-black, post-midnight buzz is the fuel that gives cuts like \"False Hope,\" \"Don't Let Me Bring You Down,\" \"Gurdjieff's Daughter,\" and the hypnotic title track their swagger. That said, Marling is an unrepentant folkie, and those late-night blasts of tube-driven self-evaluation and raw verisimilitude eventually give way to bleary-eyed mornings spent assessing the wreckage, and the album's best moments arrive via the aged wood and steel of her trusty acoustic. The dreamy, psych-tinged opener \"Warrior\" invokes Nick Drake's \"Road\" with its bluesy, open tuning and refrain of \"I can't be your horse anymore, you're not the warrior I'm looking for,\" while the equally Drake-ian \"Feel Your Love\" offers up a less defensive, but no less weary stance toward potential suitors, positing \"you must let me go before I get old, I need to find someone who really wants to be mine.\" Avoiding complacency has always been the light that guides the precocious singer/songwriter (only 25 at the time of release, this is Marling's fourth album in just five years), and Short Movie does little to temper that restlessness. It may lack the cohesion of her last outing, and her steadfast derision of anything resembling a hook can be taxing, but it makes up for its meandering with a strength of character that eludes many of her contemporaries. An old soul to say the least, Marling continues to evolve as both a musician and a writer, albeit subtly, and we're all the better for it. ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "If you scanned the back cover of the soundtrack to Shrek, without seeing the film first, it's hard not to think that this is an album that's designed to be a crossover success, containing very few songs that are in the film. You'd be wrong. Almost all of the 12 songs on this soundtrack (there's a 13th track, an excerpt of Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell's original score) are not only in the movie, but they feature prominently in the film -- which just goes to show that Shrek doesn't play by the rules of animated features, just like DreamWorks told us in the publicity drive. What that means, though, is that it plays by the soundtrack rules of most mainstream comedies, down to the use of the omnipresent Smash Mouth not once, but twice. The record does take a couple of detours from the conventional though, no doubt thanks to DreamWorks' desire to keep their hip NPR audience and to promote their own artists as well. So, when it does deviate from the norm, it's for the eels' \"My Beloved Monster\" (from the 1996 DreamWorks release Beautiful Freak) and for Rufus Wainwright's cover of Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\" (not heard in the film, where it was sung by John Cale, but Wainwright is part of the DreamWorks family and he has an album coming out a few weeks after the release of Shrek), along with a cover of Joan Jett's \"Bad Reputation\" by Halfcocked (again, not in the film, where the original was used) and the Proclaimers' 1988 chestnut \"I'm on My Way.\" Though these detours are a little questionable, they are enjoyable, but they still don't alter the character of a record that's essentially just a soundtrack, without much of the personality of the film it's attached to. It's not bad, but it's not great, either. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Both artistically and commercially, Boz Scaggs had his greatest success with Silk Degrees. The laid-back singer hit the R&B charts in a big way with the addictive, sly \"Lowdown\" (which has been sampled by more than a few rappers and remains a favorite among baby-boomer soul fans) and expressed his love of smooth soul music almost as well on the appealing \"What Can I Say.\" But Scaggs was essentially a pop/rocker, and in that area he has a considerable amount of fun on \"Lido Shuffle\" (another major hit single), \"What Do You Want the Girl to Do,\" and \"Jump Street.\" Meanwhile, \"We're All Alone\" and \"Harbor Lights\" became staples on adult contemporary radio. Though not remarkable, the ballads have more heart than most of the bland material dominating that format. [A 2007 re-release added three bonus tracks, \"What Can I Say,\" \"Jump Street,\" and \"It's Over.\"] ~ Alex Henderson",

        "summary": "Forget the rampant labeling of Zero 7 as the \"British Air,\" because Simple Things is a debut album that stands on its own as a chilled, subtle collection of organic songs. There are hints of Air, but there are equally relevant comparisons that might be made with Morcheeba, Rae & Christian, Nightmares on Wax, and early Massive Attack. Indeed, after Morcheeba's overproduced Fragments of Freedom and Rae & Christian's sloppy Sleepwalking, Simple Things picks up the slack in a rewarding manner. Simple Things might just be a gentle Cinderella, a kind stepsister to Massive Attack's dark masterpiece, Mezzanine. It's rare that a post-trip-hop album is so interesting and engrossing, but the duo of Henry Binns and Sam Hardaker mix a number of musical elements, such as soul-influenced diva vocals, gurgling and ringing keyboards, and classical string arrangements, into a relaxing, potent wave of sounds. Though the album starts to meander in its closing tracks, the first 50 minutes are cohesive, vibrant, and calming. Highlights are too numerous to call out, as the duo switches from instrumentals to songs featuring passionate, energized vocals from Mozez, Sia Furler, and Sophie Barker. All three vocalists mingle as perfect matches to the smart arrangements. Twinkling keyboards, barely-there basslines, and acoustic guitars create rolling melodies that never interfere with the task at hand, that of chiseling textured aural atmospheres. Simple Things is an accomplished slice of soulful genius that rewards frequent spins. ~ Tim DiGravina",

        "summary": "It turns out that bearded gents Sam Beam of Iron & Wine and Ben Bridwell of Band of Horses were friends in their hometown of Columbia, South Carolina back before they were ever touring-bill companions or Sub Pop labelmates (mid- to late aughts), and well before they recorded a covers album together. Perhaps a studio collaboration was inevitable or even overdue given their amity, frequent path-crossing, and shared tastes and influences represented small-scale here on the 12-track Sing Into My Mouth. The title is taken from lyrics in the opening track, \"This Must Be the Place\" by Talking Heads, a sign of the relative diversity to come, which bridges Sade, John Cale, El Perro del Mar, and Peter La Farge. The Talking Heads tune is a toned-down take with acoustic and slide guitars, bass, piano, accordion, and light percussion, representative of an album full of slide guitar-heavy arrangements that fall squarely within folky expectations. Versions most similar to the originals include Ronnie Lane's \"Done This One Before,\" '70s U.K. band Unicorn's \"No Way Out of Here\" (better known via David Gilmore's cover), Spiritualized's \"Straight and Narrow,\" and fellow South Carolinians the Marshall Tucker Band's beautifully spare \"Ab's Song\" -- all folk-inspired or twang-leaning to begin with, and covered affectionately with Beam and Bridwell trading lead-vocal duty throughout the record. Most altered are the duo's reworkings of the strings-supported, Brill Building-esque \"God Knows (You Gotta Give to Get)\" by Sweden's El Perro del Mar, which is slowed down here and given an earthy woodwind and guitar delivery; Sade's \"Bullet Proof Soul,\" which still sounds uniquely Sade despite a rootsy rearrangement; and Them Two's 1967 soul plea \"Am I a Good Man?,\" previously covered by Bridwell's Band of Horses and captured with enthusiasm on Sing Into My Mouth by piano, reed instruments, electric guitars, bass, and percussion. Other songs include Bonnie Raitt's \"Anyday Woman,\" John Cale's \"You Know Me More Than I Know,\" and J.J. Cale's \"Magnolia.\" That kind of variety keeps things interesting, though none of the arrangements comes as a real surprise with the exception of the closer, \"Coyote, My Little Brother\" (later covered by Pete Seeger but recorded by its songwriter Peter La Farge in 1963), a yodeling, Native American-inspired lament that gets full dream pop treatment with Bridwell on lead. Still, the represented songwriters and the sequencing, which nimbly waltzes through 50 years of song selections beginning with a quirky new wave tune and ending with a howling cautionary ballad, are rendered with grace. Those attracted to the collaboration's premise will very likely appreciate its results. ~ Marcy Donelson",

        "summary": "After a solid run of albums that showed growth each time, Future Islands explode into greatness on their fourth album, and first for 4AD, 2014's Singles. Streamlining their synth-heavy, experimental, almost danceable sound of the past into something laser-focused, new wave familiar, and very, very immediate, the album is a great leap forward that's filled with intensely catchy songs and allows vocalist Samuel T. Herring to shine like the star he's always been. His David Thomas of Pere Ubu meets David Prater of Sam & Dave singing style is both more expansive than ever and more restrained. He ducks and bobs around the pulsing disco beats and glittering synths like a boxer, sometimes knocking you out with histrionic growls and deep-throated snarls, sometimes setting you up with lightly crooned pleading that hits like a heart punch. It's a masterful performance that's matched by Chris Coady's expert production and the work of bassist/guitarist William Cashion and guitarist/synthist J. Gerrit Welmers (as well as session drummer Denny Bowen). Coady smooths the group's sound out without sacrificing any punch, then layers in horns, backing vocals, and keys until the album shines like a well-polished diamond. Cashion's bass work is the key supporting player, rumbling like a propulsive motor and laying down melodic lines he must have learned through hours of studying Peter Hook's best work. Welmers' keyboard work isn't far behind, as he always drops in the right fills and uses the perfect colors to fill in behind the action. It's a perfectly constructed sound that gives Herring the freedom to spill his guts without fear, and in the end works to make the record's title sound truer than they probably even imagined. Every song sounds like a past, present, and future hit single, with ringing hooks, grooves that won't leave your hips alone, and the kind of cutting emotional depth that will leave blood pooling around your feet as it slashes you again and again. Pick any song, like the achingly pretty \"Seasons (Waiting on You)\" or the understated \"Light House\" or the after-hours Roxy Music-inspired \"Like the Moon,\" and it'll be the kind of song that will stop people in their tracks in a crowded bar, the kind that you play over and over when you run across it streaming on a website, the kind that you tell all your friends about. A whole album of songs like that feels like a dream come true. It's real, though, and the vocals, the songs, the music, and the production work together to make Singles a one-of-a-kind experience that's nearly perfect.

        "summary": "The Swedish indie pop group Amason do a fine job embodying the sound of their home country on their debut album, Sky City. Sleek, sophisticated, slightly reserved, and suffused with melody, they end up somewhere between the Concretes and Peter Bjorn and John on the Swedish pop spectrum, which turns out to be a nice place to reside. Featuring a collection of musicians from established bands like Miike Snow, Dungen, and Little Majorette, it's clear that they have the chops to deliver a solid pop album and they certainly do here. With songs that range from soft rock pastiches (the America-quoting \"Kelly\") to tiny pieces of dramatic melancholy (\"Went to War\") and quite a few that seem like they came from the pages of PB and J's songbook (\"Blackfish\"), the band is working a narrow seam of music bordered by Fleetwood Mac on one side and, well, Peter Bjorn and John on the other. This laser-pointed focus serves them well, as it sets a mood that's never broken and deepens as the album goes on. Even the couple of songs that boost the tempo a bit (the rambunctious \"NFB\") or stretch out some (the atmospheric instrumental \"Pink Amason\") fit perfectly within the overall aesthetic. Also making the album a delight are the lovely vocals of Amanda Bergman, whose raspy croon delivers maximum impact with minimal fuss, an approach that fits well with the restraint that's shown with both the tightly drawn arrangements and the uncluttered production. There are a couple moments where the album gets overly somber, and the saxophone solo on \"Kelly\" should have been left on the cutting-room floor, but for the most part Sky City is a promising, quietly satisfying debut. ~ Tim Sendra",

        "summary": "A succession of taut rockers and introspective ballads, Code 90's budget-priced reissue of Marc Bolan's finest boogie bristles with power and excitement, a solid 16-track reminder of the year in which T. Rex could do no wrong. Whether stalking the ballrooms with amps on stun or reveling in the otherworldly wordiness that rounds up some of Bolan's most eternal lyricism, The Slider is both Marc Bolan's most electrifying album and his most personal. \"Ballrooms of Mars\" and \"Spaceball Ricochet,\" in particular, evoke candid memories of Bolan at his most absolutely vulnerable, while \"Metal Guru,\" the chart-topping follow-up to \"Telegram Sam,\" stands as both the archetypal T. Rex single and the most triumphantly flamboyant, opening the album with a yell of pure joy before slamming into a lyric whose buoyant nursery rhyme quality seriously belied its content. Three bonus tracks, period B-sides \"Cadillac,\" \"Thunderwing,\" and the stupendously sauntering \"Lady,\" complete the package and, if you've somehow managed to avoid owning this album in the past, the price ensures that you now have no choice. It's worth its weight in gold, after all. ~ Dave Thompson",

        "summary": "Peter Gabriel introduced his fifth studio album, So, with \"Sledgehammer,\" an Otis Redding-inspired soul-pop raver that was easily his catchiest, happiest single to date. Needless to say, it was also his most accessible, and, in that sense it was a good introduction to So, the catchiest, happiest record he ever cut. \"Sledgehammer\" propelled the record toward blockbuster status, and Gabriel had enough songs with single potential to keep it there. There was \"Big Time,\" another colorful dance number; \"Don't Give Up,\" a moving duet with Kate Bush; \"Red Rain,\" a stately anthem popular on album rock radio; and \"In Your Eyes,\" Gabriel's greatest love song, which achieved genuine classic status after being featured in Cameron Crowe's classic Say Anything. These all illustrated the strengths of the album: Gabriel's increased melodicism and ability to blend African music, jangly pop, and soul into his moody art rock. Apart from these singles, plus the urgent \"That Voice Again,\" the rest of the record is as quiet as the album tracks of Security. The difference is, the singles on that record were part of the overall fabric; here, the singles are the fabric, which can make the album seem top-heavy (a fault of many blockbuster albums, particularly those of the mid-'80s). Even so, those songs are so strong, finding Gabriel in a newfound confidence and accessibility, that it's hard not to be won over by them, even if So doesn't develop the unity of its two predecessors.

        "summary": "A convincing argument that rock & roll doesn't need reinvention in order to revive itself, Courtney Barnett's full-length debut Sometimes I Sit and Think, And Sometimes I Just Sit. falls into a long, storied rock tradition but never feels beholden to it. By almost any measure, Barnett is a traditionalist -- a singer/songwriter supported by a guitar-bass-drum trio, cranking out ballads and squalls of noise. Certainly, those flurries of six-string fury do recall a variety of indie rock from the '90s, an era when there was a surplus of guitar-friendly singer/songwriters, and if Sometimes I Sit does occasionally seem reminiscent of Liz Phair's landmark Exile in Guyville, it also seems to go back even further, sometimes suggesting the twitchy nerves of the former pub rockers who cranked up the volume and sharpened their invective in the wake of punk. So, Barnett might be part of a long line of underground rock troubadours but, as always, what matters is her specificity. Barnett's thick Australian accent carries an unstated pride for her homeland, but her sly twists of phrase, alternately wry and melancholic, give a greater sense of place, time, and character. Offhand observations mingle with understated insights, a nice trick of songwriting that the music cannily mirrors. When called upon, Barnett and her band can be furious -- \"An Illustration of Loneliness\" and \"Kim's Caravan\" both work themselves up to a knotty, gnarled head -- but they can also slip into a soothing sadness (\"Depreston,\" \"Boxing Day Blues\"). Usually, they're punchy but not precise, hammering the hard hooks of \"Aqua Profunda!\" and \"Nobody Really Cares If You Don't Go to the Party\" into place, giving \"Elevator Operator\" and \"Pedestrian at Best\" an urgency that mimics Barnett's cloistered, clever words. There are no frills here but there is a distinct, compelling voice evident in Barnett's songs and music alike. That's what makes Sometimes I Sit and Think, And Sometimes I Just Sit. so invigorating: it may have roots -- perhaps even some inadvertent ones -- but it's music that lives thoroughly in the moment. [Sometimes I Sit and Think, And Sometimes I Just Sit. was also released with a six-track bonus disc.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Musicologists (and folks eager to sound like them) have long contended that hip-hop and its offshoots are simply the latest links in the chain that extends from traditional blues and R&B, as well as the African-American oral tradition, but more casual listeners often shrug off such notions, insisting hip-hop is just some sort of urban noise that sprang out of nowhere. The first full-length album from Son Little (the stage name of songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Aaron Livingston) could be seen as an essay in 12 songs about how the trajectories of blues, soul, and hip-hop cross paths and reveal a common source and mindset, though at no time does Little's music suggest this was ever his guiding principle while making this music. Vintage blues and R&B are at the heart of Son Little's sounds, but on most tracks you have to listen for a minute or two before you can figure out just what bit has been scavenged from where, and while electronic beats and digital manipulation of sounds are clearly a big part of how these tracks were created, this is music that was informed by hip-hop without actually being hip-hop (the songs may have been constructed using bits and pieces of common blues figures, but if there's any sampling on this album, it's subtle enough to never call attention to itself). What Son Little ultimately delivers on this album is something fascinating and unexpected; from the sparse and ominous opener \"I'm Gone\" (primarily built around the ghostly refrain \"You get what you get, and don't expect a thing\") and the doomstruck 12-bar creep of \"Loser Blues\" to the fuzzy stomp-down groove and random noise bursts of the sexy and obsessive \"Toes\" and the ghostly sweet soul of \"Lay Down,\" this music brings together past and present, each on its own terms, but adds an ineffable sense of mystery that's clearly Little's personal vision. The deep, narcotic texture of this music recalls nothing as much as the beer-addled visions of Basehead's lost masterpiece Play with Toys, but with the obsession with getting buzzed replaced by love, sex, and Little's place in an often unforgiving world. Sometimes troubling, frequently joyous, and always articulate and thoroughly individual, Son Little's cross-genre shape-shifting reveals more compelling nuances with each listen, and this is one of the most interesting and rewarding debuts of 2015. ~ Mark Deming",

After the band's demise in 1999, frontman Adam Levine surrounded himself with New York City's urban hip-hop culture and found a new musical calling. Maroon 5 were born and their debut album, Songs About Jane, illustrates an impressive rebirth. It's groovy in spots, offering bluesy funk on \"Shiver\" and a catchy, soulful disposition on \"Harder to Breathe.\" \"Must Get Out\" slows things down with its dreamy lyrical story, and Levine is a vocal dead ringer for Men at Work's Colin Hay. Don't wince -- it works brilliantly. Songs About Jane is love-drunk on what makes Maroon 5 tick as a band. They're not as glossy as the Phantom Planet darlings; they've got grit and a sexy strut, personally and musically. It's much too slick to cross over commercially in 2002, but it's good enough for the pop kids to take notice. [Songs About Jane's 20th Anniversary Edition contains a bonus disc with demo versions of every one of the album's 12 songs, plus demos of four non-LP songs -- including the international B-side \"Ragdoll\" -- and an alternate mix of \"The Sun.\"] ~ MacKenzie Wilson",

Released in 1971, it is a collection of songs that reflect change, transition, and starting over. The set was recorded in both Los Angeles and San Francisco, in the immediate aftermath of Nash's traumatic breakup with Joni Mitchell. Unlike the colorful dynamism of Stephen Stills' eponymous debut recording, or the acid-drenched cosmic cowboy spaciness of David Crosby'sIf I Could Only Remember My Name, Nash's album is by contrast a much more humble and direct offering. It is a true, mostly introspective songwriter's album full of beautifully performed and wonderfully recorded songs that reflect transition, movement, the desire to look backward and forward simultaneously. Like the aforementioned offering, this one is star-studded in its choice of players and singers: Crosby, Chris Ethridge, Jerry Garcia, Rita Coolidge, Clydie King, Venetta Fields, Dave Mason, Neil Young (under the pseudonym \"Joe Yankee\"), David Lindley, Bobby Keys, Phil Lesh, Dallas Taylor, and drummer John Barbata reflect some of the personnel on this heady yet humble session. The album is bookended by two of Nash's best-known tunes, the anthemic \"Military Madness\" that remains timeless in the 21st century, and \"Chicago,\" that doesn't. That said, they are among the weakest songs here -- which reveals what a solid collection it is. Unlike many recordings birthed from personal angst, Nash's engages in no self pity; instead, he focuses on the craft of songwriting itself. Despite its personal darkness, \"Better Days,\" with its swirling piano and pronounced bassline, is also an actual paean to self-determination and perseverance, the logic being that there were better days in the past, so there must be better ones in the future as well. \"I Used to Be a King,\" with Garcia on a gorgeous pedal steel and Lesh on bass, is a direct, mature response to \"King Midas in Reverse,\" a song Nash wrote and recorded with the Hollies. \"Simple Man,\" with its sparse melody and strings and a fine backing vocal from Coolidge, was written on the afternoon of the breakup with Mitchell. The violin-cello backdrop to Nash's piano is particularly effective and makes this one of his most memorable songs. The parlor room country waltz that commences \"Man in the Mirror,\" features Garcia's steel, Young's piano, ex-Flying Burrito Brother Ethridge, and drummer Barbata; it shifts keys, tempo, and feel about a third of the way in with a very long bridge that transforms the song's sentiment as well. Ultimately, Songs for Beginners is the strongest of Nash's solo efforts (outside of his work with Crosby). The 2008 Rhino edition is completely remastered; it also contains a DVD that features the album in DVD Audio with a 5.1 mix, as well as photos and an interview with Nash. ~ Thom Jurek",

        "parentTitle": "Stevie Wonder",
        "summary": "Songs in the Key of Life was Stevie Wonder's longest, most ambitious collection of songs, a two-LP (plus accompanying EP) set that -- just as the title promised -- touched on nearly every issue under the sun, and did it all with ambitious (even for him), wide-ranging arrangements and some of the best performances of Wonder's career. The opening \"Love's in Need of Love Today\" and \"Have a Talk with God\" are curiously subdued, but Stevie soon kicks into gear with \"Village Ghetto Land,\" a fierce exposÃ© of ghetto neglect set to a satirical Baroque synthesizer. Hot on its heels comes the torrid fusion jam \"Contusion,\" a big, brassy hit tribute to the recently departed Duke Ellington in \"Sir Duke,\" and (another hit, this one a Grammy winner as well) the bumping poem to his childhood, \"I Wish.\" Though they didn't necessarily appear in order, Songs in the Key of Life contains nearly a full album on love and relationships, along with another full album on issues social and spiritual. Fans of the love album Talking Book can marvel that he sets the bar even higher here, with brilliant material like the tenderly cathartic and gloriously redemptive \"Joy Inside My Tears,\" the two-part, smooth-and-rough \"Ordinary Pain,\" the bitterly ironic \"All Day Sucker,\" or another classic heartbreaker, \"Summer Soft.\" Those inclined toward Stevie Wonder the social-issues artist had quite a few songs to focus on as well: \"Black Man\" was a Bicentennial school lesson on remembering the vastly different people who helped build America; \"Pastime Paradise\" examined the plight of those who live in the past and have little hope for the future; \"Village Ghetto Land\" brought listeners to a nightmare of urban wasteland; and \"Saturn\" found Stevie questioning his kinship with the rest of humanity and amusingly imagining paradise as a residency on a distant planet. If all this sounds overwhelming, it is; Stevie Wonder had talent to spare during the mid-'70s, and instead of letting the reserve trickle out during the rest of the decade, he let it all go with one massive burst. (His only subsequent record of the '70s was the similarly gargantuan but largely instrumental soundtrack Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants.) ~ John Bush",

        "summary": "On their 2012 debut Boys & Girls, Alabama Shakes never hid that they were creatures of the New South -- a band with old-fashioned blues, soul, gospel, and country in their blood but raised on modern rock. On their 2015 follow-up, Sound & Color, they free themselves from the vestiges of the past, let loose, and push themselves further in either direction. This could've resulted in a disjointed record pulling itself in two opposing directions, but the mess of Sound & Color is invigorating, likely because the album uses its title as a creed. Where Boys & Girls sometimes seemed a shade austere -- the band took pains to color within the lines, almost as if to convey their good taste -- Sound & Color bursts with oversaturated hues so vivid they seem almost tangible. Such deep digressions into shade and light accentuate both the group's roots and modernity, but the very fact that they chase after such bold, elastic sounds signals they're hardly a throwback. Plus, the group's attack is muscular here: there's a strong, boundless funk to \"Don't Wanna Fight,\" but there's a similar power behind the slow-churning soul ballad \"Gimme All Your Love.\" Often, Sound & Color takes flight when Alabama Shakes channel that energy into ever-shifting, liquid performances that almost feel like roots psychedelia, typified by \"Future People\" skipping off its tight Memphis groove with spooky harmonies and thudding fuzz. Such unaffected weird flourishes are evidence that Alabama Shakes are creatures of their time and place -- they play Southern soul-rock in an era where the past is indistinguishable from the present, and how the band interlaces the old and the new on Sound & Color feels startlingly fresh.

        "summary": "Simon & Garfunkel's second album, Sounds of Silence, was recorded 18 months after their debut long-player, Wednesday Morning, 3 AM -- but even though the two albums shared one song (actually, one-and-a-half songs) in common, the sound here seemed a million miles away from the gentle harmonizing and unassuming acoustic accompaniment on the first record. In between, there had been a minor earthquake in the pop/rock world called \"folk-rock,\" which resulted in the transformation of their acoustic rendition of \"The Sound of Silence\" into a classic of the new genre, complete with jangling electric guitars and an amplified beat that helped carry it to the top of the charts. The duo hastily re-formed, Paul Simon returning from an extended stay in England with a large song bag (part of which he had already committed to vinyl, on his U.K. album The Paul Simon Songbook). Simon & Garfunkel rushed into the studio in the fall of 1965 to come up with a folk-rock album in a hurry: fortunately, they'd already recorded two sides, \"Somewhere They Can't Find Me\" (actually, Simon's rewrite of their first albumâs title track) and \"We've Got a Groovey Thing Goin',\" both featuring a band accompaniment. Davy Graham's bluesy \"Anji,\" a rare instrumental outing by Simon, filled another slot, and \"Richard Cory\" filled another. The latter, Simon's adaptation of poet Edwin Arlington Robinsonâs work, was a sincere effort at relevance -- Richard Cory has every material thing a man could want but still takes his own life, a hint at one aspect of middle-class teenaged angst of the mid-'60s; high school English teachers were still using it to motivate students in the '70s. Though a rushed effort, this was a far stronger album than their debut, mostly thanks to Simon's compositions; indeed, in one fell swoop, the world learned not only of the existence of a superb song-poet in Paul Simon, but, in Simon's harmonizing with Art Garfunkel, the finest singing duo since the Everly Brothers. But it also had flaws, some of which only became fully apparent as their audience matured: the snide, youthful sensibilities of \"I Am a Rock\" and \"Blessed\" haven't aged well. And the musical concessions, on those tracks and \"Richard Cory,\" to folk-rock amplification have also worn poorly; even in 1966, the electric guitars, piano, organ, and drums, sounded awkward in context with the duo's singing, like something grafted on, though in fairness, those sounds did sell the album. The parts that work best, \"Kathy's Song\" and \"April Come She Will,\" two of the most personal songs in Simon's output, were similar to the stripped-down originals Simon had cut solo in England, and among the most affecting (as opposed to affected) folk-style records of their era; similarly, Simon's rendition of the folk-blues instrumental \"Anji\" is close to composer Davy Graham's original, just recorded hotter, while \"Leaves That Are Green\" is pleasantly if unobtrusively ornamented with electric harpsichord, rhythm guitar, and bass. ~ Bruce Eder",

        "summary": "Texas is a place where folks do things their own way, which may be why so many artists in the Lone Star State love psychedelia but play it with a distinct twist, as anyone who has spent much time listening to the 13th Floor Elevators, the Red Krayola, or Cold Sun can tell you. Austin's Bright Light Social Hour are doing their part to keep the grand tradition of Texas Trippiness alive, and their second album, 2015's Space Is Still the Place, is an ambitious and wildly entertaining journey into the minds of the men who created it. While the echoey stirrings of the more languid songs reveals a lovely, lysergic sparkle that rises and falls over the whole of this album, Bright Lights Social Hour draw from an impressive range of influences, rhythm & blues, and off-center pop music, and even though these ten songs explore the nooks and crannies of the musical space around them, this is thankfully short on jam-band-style meandering. Bassist Jack OâBrien and drummer Joseph Mirasole keep this music tightly on track throughout, with rhythms that are rock hard or coolly grooving depending on the number (and sometimes adding a subtle electronic assist), and guitarist Curtis Roush punctuates the songs with clever solos and instrumental textures that add to the mood of the songs without calling undue attention to themselves; Edward Braillif's keyboards gracefully shift gears from the cool post-disco feel of \"The Moon\" to the '70s-rock stylings of \"Aperture.\" While the members of Bright Lights Social Hour have said they intended Space Is Still the Place to make a statement about the need for new thinking at a time when economic and social woes are sapping the spirit of younger Americans, most of the lyrics don't stand out much on the first few listens, as they're mixed into the middle distance and layered with echo and reverb effects. But the band's intent to take the listener somewhere else succeeds admirably, and Space Is Still the Place is a smart, fearless work from a band whose inner journey is paying impressive musical dividends. ~ Mark Deming",

        "summary": "The expanded double-disc 40th Anniversary reissue of David Bowie's Space Oddity -- for all intents and purposes, his first true album, originally appearing in 1969 as Man of Words, Man of Music and following a largely forgotten 1967 debut for Deram -- contains 15 bonus tracks, all gathered on a second disc. Eight of these tracks are previously unreleased, highlighted by a pair of demos -- billed as never bootlegged -- that open the disc: one of the first versions of \"Space Oddity\" followed by \"An Occasional Dream.\" The other unreleased cuts are largely different mixes: an unreleased stereo mix of \"Conversation Piece,\" alternate album mixes of \"Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud\" and \"Memory of a Free Festival,\" an alternate stereo mix of \"London Bye Ta Ta,\" and a full-length Italian version of \"Space Oddity.\" There's also a BBC session of \"Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed\" that somehow escaped compilers of 2002's Bowie at the Beeb and that, along with the other two BBC sessions, are a highlight here. Like the proper album, this bonus disc is a little bit of a hodge-podge but enjoyably so, as the formative moments and alternate-take repetition are goosed along by several true gems: those kinetic BBC sessions, the glamtastic \"London Bye Ta-Ta,\" the alternate \"Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud\" with a Paul Buckmaster intro, and a longer version of \"Memory of a Free Festival.\" [Space Oddity was re-released on LP for its 40th Anniversary in 2009.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Talking Heads found a way to open up the dense textures of the music they had developed with Brian Eno on their two previous studio albums for Speaking in Tongues, and were rewarded with their most popular album yet. Ten backup singers and musicians accompanied the original quartet, but somehow the sound was more spacious, and the music admitted aspects of gospel, notably in the call-and-response of \"Slippery People,\" and John Lee Hooker-style blues on \"Swamp.\" As usual, David Byrne determinedly sang and chanted impressionistic, nonlinear lyrics, sometimes by mix-and-matching clichÃ©s (\"No visible means of support and you have not seen nothin' yet,\" he declared on \"Burning Down the House,\" the Heads' first Top Ten hit), and the songs' very lack of clear meaning was itself a lyrical subject. \"Still don't make no sense,\" Byrne admitted in \"Making Flippy Floppy,\" but by the next song, \"Girlfriend Is Better,\" that had become an order -- \"Stop making sense,\" he chanted over and over. Some of his charming goofiness had returned since the overly serious Remain in Light and Fear of Music, however, and the accompanying music, filled with odd percussive and synthesizer sounds, could be unusually light and bouncy. The album closer, \"This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody),\" even sounds hopeful. Well, sort of. Despite their formal power, Talking Heads' preceding two albums seemed to have painted them into a corner, which may be why it took them three years to craft a follow-up, but on Speaking in Tongues, they found an open window and flew out of it. [In the fall of 2005, Talking Heads' catalog was finally remastered and reissued as DualDiscs, containing a CD on one side and a DVD with 5.1 mixes, along with bonus video material, on the other. Initially, the DualDiscs were only available as a box set, but in 2006, the albums were reissued individually as digipacks (the box set contained all white jewel cases). Speaking in Tongues has just two bonus tracks: the unfinished \"Two Note Swivel,\" which is closer than anything on Fear of Music or Remain in Light to being completed, since David Byrne actually has words in addition to the melody, plus an alternate \"Burning Down the House\" that isn't as lively as the finished version; the DVD contains videos for \"Burning Down the House\" and \"This Must Be the Place.\"] ~ William Ruhlmann",

        "summary": "Marlena Shaw's penchant for stylistic variety is certainly evident on this, her sophomore release. Cut for the Cadet label in 1969, Spice of Life ranges from soul and proto-funk to jazz and MOR-hued material. Shaw shines throughout, showing her power on politically charged, Aretha-styled cuts like \"Woman of the Ghetto\" and \"Liberation Conversation,\" while also delivering supple interpretations of such traditional jazz fare as \"Go Away Little Boy\" (shades of Nancy Wilson). And with a gutsy take on \"Stormy Monday,\" it's clear Shaw doesn't shrink from the blues either. Across this sound spectrum, arrangers Richard Evans and Charles Stepney envelope Shaw in unobtrusive yet exciting pop-soul environs, throwing kalimba runs (a few years before Earth, Wind & Fire picked up on the instrument), psych guitar accents, and bongo-fueled organ riffs into the mix. Their widescreen touch is particularly well essayed on strings-and-brass standouts like the Bacharach-inspired Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil composition \"Looking Through the Eyes of Love\" and Ashford & Simpson's \"California Soul\" (a classic reading heavily favored by the crate-digging set). A perfect way to get familiar with Shaw's impressive early work. ~ Stephen Cook",

        "summary": "Ever since he released his first record, Langhorne Slim seems to have been searching for a sound that suits his emphatic yet introspective lyrical style and rootsy melodies, from the scrappy sitting-around-the-campfire mood of his 2005 debut When the Sun's Gone Down to the polished and cleanly orchestrated figures on 2009's Be Set Free. On his fifth full-length album, 2015's The Spirit Moves, Slim has finally recruited a full-time backing band, the Law, featuring David Moore on banjo and keyboards, Jeff Ratner on bass, and Malachi DeLorenzo on drums, and in many respects this makes for one of Langhorne Slim's most musically satisfying albums to date, delivering performances that are clever, taut, and intuitive but leave just enough space for Slim's impassioned vocals and elemental guitar work. Slim also had other valuable collaborators on The Spirit Moves -- producer Andrija Tokic has given these sessions just a light buff and polish that allows the details to stand out (and the sparing use of strings and horns gives the arrangements a soothing undertow without robbing the music of its organic tone and feeling), and songwriter Kenny Siegal collaborated with Slim on eight of the album's 12 songs, firming up the frameworks of the tunes while keeping Slim's essential lyrical and melodic personality firmly in place. As for Slim, he's still trying to sort out his troubles with life, love, and the world around him, but the unpretentiously intelligent outlook of his songs suggests he's a man whose navel gazing is not about just his own troubles, but the large-scale job of sorting out one man's place in a big world, and if he doesn't always have answers, at least he knows how to ask the right questions. Hopefully Langhorne Slim will have worked out a few of his deeper thoughts in his next album with the Law, but at very least The Spirit Moves sounds like a sure-footed step in the right direction. ~ Mark Deming",

        "summary": "It's an unconventional formula, to say the least: Black Moth Super Rainbow are as out-there musically as their name would imply. Psychedelia is the reference point, filtered through a childlike innocence and wonder, and implemented with bargain-basement instruments and electronics. For reference, imagine what an impromptu collaboration between Boards of Canada and M83 might sound like, especially if it took place on a lazy hazy summer afternoon at the Elephant 6 collective's studio after someone brewed some strong mushroom tea. Black Moth combine what sound like vintage analog synths and various keyboards and electronics that might have been dug out of an attic and dusted off for a thrift shop or yard sale. Add to that either a drum machine that has been dropped a few too many times or the most shoddily recorded live drummer ever. And add to that a vocalist who manipulates his voice with the cheesiest, chintziest child's vocoder ever. You wouldn't think it would work, yet it does; each track here is a gem. And while it doesn't live up to its more mature and fleshed-out follow-up, Dandelion Gum, the song sketches on Start a People lay down the blueprint for a lo-fi psychedelic manifesto unlike anything ever heard before. Standouts (in sound and title) include the Boards of Canada gone funk of \"Vietcaterpillar,\" the circular noodling of the ditty-length anthem \"I Am the Alphabet\" (represented here in two versions), the horn \"breakdown\" in \"Early 70's Gymnastics,\" the children's instructional counting singalong \"Trees and Colors and Wizards,\" and the \"exploring Mister Rogers' neighborhood on acid\" pastiche of \"I Think It Is Beautiful That You Are 256 Colors Too.\" A peek at the handful of lyrics provided suggests a darker side underneath all the sunshine and rainbows and lends weight to Black Moth's apparent utopianism and escapism. ~ Brian Way",

        "summary": "Swedish sisters Johanna and Klara SÃ¶derberg have taken what, in the era of TV talent shows and Internet stars (they were once YouTube sensations themselves), has become a rare path to major-label success. Their hard work and growth within a trusting and nurturing indie label climate have helped develop and mature their sound from the enchanting folk of their debut to the polished Americana that dominates Stay Gold. Making the jump from Wichita to Columbia Records for their third full-length has given the duo the scope to dream bigger, and that's exactly what they've managed here with an assured and comprehensive collection of songs. Noticeably more expansive than any of their previous work, Stay Gold has a rich texture of classic country instrumentation and stirring string arrangements, matching their soaring vocal melodies. They were first noticed when a charming woodland set of acoustic Fleet Foxes covers gained attention for their beautiful vocals, which are still the main draw on this release, with their close harmonies again empowering every song. The timeless chorus adorning \"Cedar Lane\" sets the song up for a belting finale, and the closing salvo \"How could I break away from you\" feels bold yet reassuring. There is plenty of introspection here that sees the sisters focus on their experiences and journey thus far, and being on the road since they were just teenagers has undoubtedly shaped the defiant slow burner \"Shattered & Hollow\" and the wandering dreams and vulnerability that seep into \"Waitress Song.\" Despite the obvious shift toward a country-influenced sound with a real romping, foot stomper in \"Heaven Knows,\" there are still folk ballads here -- \"Fleeting One\" and \"A Long Time Ago\" -- that show the delicacy and heartbreaking capacity of First Aid Kit. With a genuine sense of melancholy that is far beyond their young years, the SÃ¶derbergs have taken the mild success of their sophomore record, Lion's Roar, in their stride, and with the expert hand of Bright Eyes' Mike Mogis once again producing, the lush harmonies and melodies of this album show that they are worthy of a place in the mainstream. [Stay Gold was also released on LP.] ~ Scott Kerr",

        "summary": "Stereo Rodeo is Rusted Root's first studio album in seven years -- a long stretch of time by any measure but especially long for a group who at its heart is a working band, earning its audience by constant performances. Constant performances should lead to regular recordings, but not for Rusted Root in the new millennium, who released not a single collection of new material since the attempted pop crossover of 2002's Welcome to My Party. Stereo Rodeo has elements of that shiny gloss, but there's a heavy emphasis on their elastic worldbeat grooves which, more than ever, seem indebted to latter-day Talking Heads, only minus the esoteric egghead bent. Rusted Root still lean toward crowd-pleasing jams -- clearly evident on their slow take of Elvis' \"Suspicious Minds,\" but also on their lengthy groove-oriented cuts where mood supersedes hooks, something that is a bit of a Rusted Root trademark. So in that sense, Stereo Rodeo could be seen as a correction or a tacit apology for the pop inclinations of Welcome to My Party, a way to get the band back to their roots without drawing attention to any machinations that get them there. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Only from the Rhino Handmade web-based audio salon could such a fulfilling reissue project have likewise been so thoroughly executed. Keen-eyed and eared pop music enthusiasts will undoubtedly recognize Jack Nitzsche from his involvement with Phil Spector's \"Wrecking Crew\" and later as a producer/arranger and writer for a spectrum of talent that includes but is by no means limited to Leslie Gore, Art Pepper, Tim Buckley, Neil Young, John Tesh, Mink DeVille, and the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. Three Piece Suite: The Reprise Recordings 1971-1974 gathers three disparate sonic situations under which Nitzsche recorded, and of these only the orchestrated St. Giles Cripplegate has been issued in any form. Very little is known with regard to the other recordings, besides the fact that they were on deposit in the Warner Bros. tape archives. St. Giles Cripplegate features the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) performing six original Nitzsche scores. According to Elliot Mazer's liner notes essay, the album was the direct result of the jaw-dropping orchestral arrangements Nitzsche had done for Neil Young's Harvest album -- specifically on the tracks \"There's a World\" and \"A Man Needs a Maid.\" Although his musical scope was indeed broad by any standards, these sides are more akin to Frank Zappa's symphonic experimentations and compositions than anything linked to Nitzsche's name. Each of the works is unique, exploring various sonic boundaries. For example, \"No. 6\" -- the album's opener -- is a vertigo-inducing swirl of demented strings and bombastic percussion, capped off with a dramatic brass flourish. This starkly contrasts with the comparably sedate and languid \"No. 4 (For Mori)\" -- which foreshadows his work on Milos Foreman's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest original soundtrack. The next 11 tracks on this compilation were recorded, assembled, and even bestowed a Reprise catalog number under the eponymous title Jack Nitzsche -- yet the project remained virtually forgotten. According to the thoroughly entertaining discographical annotations, no records exist to confirm exactly who performs on these sides. With a nod to primal Todd Rundgren and the quirky harmonic genius of Brian Wilson, tracks such as \"Lower California\" and \"I'm the Loneliest Fool\" recall the idiosyncratic nature of his collaborative efforts with Van Dyke Parks, and arrangements for Tim Buckley and the Buffalo Springfield. These sides may likely be the greatest discovery the archivists at Rhino Handmade have released. Along with lyrical contributions from director Robert Downey, Nitzsche creates more than music. He is, in effect, altering mood through sound. The disc closes with four demos that chronologically fall between St. Giles Cripplegate and the unissued self-titled project mentioned above. These stark performances reveal a sensitivity and intimacy that were previously only hinted at. According to the liner notes -- which were penned by longtime Nitzsche pal and housemate Denny Bruce -- the track \"I'll Bet She Knew It\" was named after the legendary Jeannie Franklyn, a seamstress in Los Angeles for many a rock & roller. She was likewise immortalized in the song \"Tiny Dancer\" as the \"blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band.\" Likewise, \"Carly\" is a tongue-in-cheek paeon to the burgeoning singer/songwriter scare of the early '70s. Three Piece Suite is limited to an edition of 3,000 copies and available through Rhino Handmade. ~ Lindsay Planer",

        "summary": "Professional road dog Kevin Morby put in plenty of months on tour even before going solo. Morby released his solo debut, Harlem River, in late 2013 while still an actively contributing and constantly touring member of both folksy warblers Woods and indie supergroup the Babies. Shortly before the release of the spiritually wandering Harlem River, Morby migrated from his longtime Brooklyn home to the sunny shores of Los Angeles, and while Harlem River was a picture postcard of Morby's times in New York, second solo album Still Life investigates his radically different Californian surroundings, and the new inspirations and challenges that came with this move. Beginning with the low-key amble of \"The Jester, the Tramp & the Acrobat,\" Morby evokes the same meeting of storytelling and spirited, big-roots rock arrangements that Dylan perfected on albums like Desire. Indeed, \"The Ballad of Arlo Jones\" mirrors the same driven electricity in telling the story of a murdered friend that Dylan delivered on \"Hurricane.\" Morby's solo sounds aren't terrifically far removed from his work with Woods and the Babies. Tunes like \"Our Moon\" work in the same spooky acoustic colors as those bands, but look deeper into Morby's songwriting, his husky vocals guiding deceptively simple arrangements that bloom abruptly into unexpected instrumentation and structure shifts. Likewise, there are unexpected stylistic spikes to Still Life. \"Drowning\" rides a delay-drenched beat that merges spacy electronic drums and bouncy Pet Sounds bass, while the droning \"Dancer\" finds Morby multi-tracking his vocals over a meandering guitar pattern, creating a strange and airy environment that sounds akin to nothing else on the album but somehow fits perfectly. The upbeat \"Motors Runnin\" is a standout, addressing the endless and unpredictable ride of being alive while summing up the restless wonder, excitement, and confusion that lie at the core of the album and find a different voicing from song to song. [Still Life was also released on LP.] ~ Fred Thomas",

        "summary": "Many of the songs on Strange Days had been written around the same time as the ones that appeared on The Doors, and with hindsight one has the sense that the best of the batch had already been cherry picked for the debut album. For that reason, the band's second effort isn't as consistently stunning as their debut, though overall it's a very successful continuation of the themes of their classic album. Besides the hit \"Strange Days,\" highlights included the funky \"Moonlight Drive,\" the eerie \"You're Lost Little Girl,\" and the jerkily rhythmic \"Love Me Two Times,\" which gave the band a small chart single. \"My Eyes Have Seen You\" and \"I Can't See Your Face in My Mind\" are minor but pleasing entries in the group's repertoire that share a subdued Eastern psychedelic air. The 11-minute \"When the Music's Over\" would often be featured as a live showstopper, yet it also illustrated their tendency to occasionally slip into drawn-out bombast.

        "parentTitle": "Lord Huron",
        "summary": "On their follow-up, Strange Trails, Lord Huron settle into the Western themes and sense of open prairies that marked the band's debut, Lonesome Dreams. Frontman/songwriter Ben Schneider fully embraces the American West/Troubadour character, illustrated even in song titles like \"Dead Man's Hand,\" \"Meet Me in the Woods,\" and \"The Yawning Grave.\" The album's lyrics tell haunted stories of adventure and survival (\"On the night you disappeared/Oh, if I had seen it clear/But a strange light in the sky was shining right into my eyes\"), with nature imagery (\"In a grave out here where the carrions cry\"), and the occasional old-time turn of phrase (\"Before I commence my ride/I'm asking Lily to be my bride\"). With warm electric guitar sounds, soft and constant reverb, harmonized vocals, and a faint but persistent twang, it's a contemporary, specifically Fleet Foxes-reminiscent, indie folk-influenced rock haunted by allusions to the Old West. Listeners may envision fringe and spurs without any overt country presence (though there's  certainly a subtle one) outside of lilting vocals, such as on \"Way Out There.\" The band still focuses more on atmosphere and haunting, harmonic sound and rhythm than on progressions or memorable hooks, but the landscapes that they create are consistent and sound-defining, and there's no shortage of eerie beauty in the melodies. \"The Night We Met,\" in particular, has a lullaby quality to its wistful, singsong melody (\"I don't know what Iâm supposed to do/Haunted by the ghost of you\"). The record takes a few interesting musical routes on its journey: the reverbed rockabilly and surf sounds of \"The World Ender,\" the campfire-gathering feel of \"Meet Me in the Woods\" with handclaps and female vocal harmonies, and the pulsing, ramblin' road tune \"Frozen Pines\" all contribute to an impression of timelessness as well as a certain folksiness befitting the album's well-established rural themes. There are no big surprises here; fans of Lonesome Dreams will surely be pleased, and Strange Trails' serene ambience and unconventional narrative may capture the imagination of inclined first-timers. ~ Marcy Donelson",

        "summary": "Billy Joel teamed with Phil Ramone, a famed engineer who had just scored his first producing hits with Art Garfunkel's Breakaway and Paul Simon's Still Crazy After All These Years for The Stranger, his follow-up to Turnstiles. Joel still favored big, sweeping melodies, but Ramone convinced him to streamline his arrangements and clean up the production. The results aren't necessarily revelatory, since he covered so much ground on Turnstiles, but the commercialism of The Stranger is a bit of a surprise. None of his ballads have been as sweet or slick as \"Just the Way You Are\"; he never had created a rocker as bouncy or infectious as \"Only the Good Die Young\"; and the glossy production of \"She's Always a Woman\" disguises its latent misogynist streak. Joel balanced such radio-ready material with a series of New York vignettes, seemingly inspired by Springsteen's working-class fables and clearly intended to be the artistic centerpieces of the album. They do provide The Stranger with the feel of a concept album, yet there is no true thematic connection between the pieces, and his lyrics are often vague or mean-spirited. His lyrical shortcomings are overshadowed by his musical strengths. Even if his melodies sound more Broadway than Beatles -- the epic suite \"Scenes From an Italian Restaurant\" feels like a show-stopping closer -- there's no denying that the melodies of each song on The Stranger are memorable, so much so that they strengthen the weaker portions of the album. Joel rarely wrote a set of songs better than those on The Stranger, nor did he often deliver an album as consistently listenable. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "RAC's Andre Allen Anjos spent the better part of a decade establishing himself as one of music's hardest-working remixers, crafting a sound that straddled the line between indie and pop with a capital P. On Strangers, his first album of original material, Anjos collaborates with many of the artists whose songs he remixed, including YACHT, Penguin Prison, and Tokyo Police Club, but his most recognizable contribution is still his playful, detailed production work. RAC's sound remains bouncy and just short of busy, dominated by breezy synths and chugging muted guitars. This distinctive-yet-homogenous approach puts Anjos' collaborators in the spotlight, and Strangers works best when the singers have enough charisma to sell this formula. The previously released singles remain highlights: \"Let Go,\" which features MNDR and Bloc Party's Kele, is as bouncy and bittersweet as ever, and a refreshing contrast to the angular rock the band returned to on Four. \"Hollywood,\" a collaboration with Penguin Prison's Chris Glover, has a slick, new wave vibe that evokes Julian Casablancas' solo work. Several of Strangers' newer tracks are nearly as good, particularly the collaborations with Body Language, Tegan & Sara, and Peter, Bjorn & John's Peter Moren. \"Ready for It,\" which features St. Lucia's Jean-Philip and Patricia Beranek Grobler, feels like a 21st century update of Animotion or Human League with its fizzy synth-pop and girl-guy vocals, while the poignant \"Tourist\" finds Tokyo Police Club's David Monks wondering, \"Are we strangers forever or are we strangers for now?\" in another of the album's standouts. At other times, Strangers feels so cohesive that it borders on anonymous. Even though tracks such as the pretty piano ballad \"We Belong\" and the marimba-driven \"Seventeen\" offer some variety, the album's sameness is amplified by its length; at nearly an hour-long, songs get lost in the shuffle. At its best, Strangers is undeniably and insistently catchy; at its worst, it's a reminder that being a good remixer and a good songwriter isn't necessarily the same thing. Still, there's enough fun -- and potential -- here to make it worth hearing what RAC does next. ~ Heather Phares",

Surely, there were signs of aimlessness on We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank, the 2007 sequel to the surprise 2004 smash Good News for People Who Love Bad News, a record where hired gun Johnny Marr was brought aboard to give the band a jolt. This booster shot wore off quickly and Brock receded from the spotlight, sitting out the better part of a decade before re-emerging with Strangers to Ourselves in the spring of 2015. In the interim, he shed longterm collaborator Eric Judy -- he left sometime around 2012, replaced by Russell Higbee -- added guitarist Jim Fairchild and auxiliary player Lisa Molinaro, attempted to record an album with Big Boi, toyed with bringing Krist Novoselic aboard, then finally decided to get back to where he once belonged. Brock's return to roots is naturally a roundabout of detours, a record that bounces between stylized eccentricity and streamlined strangeness, stopping occasionally to soak in a scenic, dreamy view. Strangers to Ourselves starts at this hazy point, swooning with a narcotic sway that recalls peak Mercury Rev, but it's not long before Modest Mouse begins bouncing at a syncopation that recalls \"Float On,\" just one of many deliberate references to the ghosts of alt-rock past haunting Strangers to Ourselves. \"Pistol\" skeeves out like a disco-fied outtake from Ween's Pure Guava, the carnivalesque \"Sugar Boats\" lurches forward on a circus piano reminiscent of Blur, \"The Best Room\" circles around a guitar riff that echoes Space Ghost Coast to Coast, each a signal that Brock is comfortable keeping the dream of the '90s. The trick is, he now has the skill of a consummate craftsman, so the raggedness here comes across as deliberate, probably because the moments that are less consciously quirky -- i.e., the bulk of the album -- are so skillfully constructed. So, Strangers to Ourselves is an album where the trees matter more than the forest: song for song, it demonstrates the exacting nature of Brock but put it all together, it sprawls. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

Perhaps due in part to the reissue of several James albums during the preceding several years, this set was available as a digital download only. It includes not only the albums in their entirety, but many bonus tracks -- extended and instrumental versions from the original 12\" releases, along with new mixes of \"You and I\" from John Morales. Each album was also given a separate digital release, though some of the bonus tracks found here were not included with them. For instance, Glow here is enhanced with 11 bonus tracks while the individual version has only five. Regardless, this should, at last, keep James' Gordy releases in easily obtained circulation for perpetuity. ~ Andy Kellman",

        "summary": "These days, every band seems eager to honor the anniversary of one of its landmark albums, usually in the form of a concert tour or an expanded reissue, and even Yo La Tengo have gotten into the act -- a quarter century after they released their endlessly charming 1990 LP Fakebook, in which they covered a handful of their favorite songs and reworked a few of their own numbers in semi-acoustic fashion, YLT have recorded what amounts to a sequel, 2015's Stuff Like That There. Just like a sequel to a 1980s horror movie, Stuff Like That There follows the template of the original as closely as possible -- there are two new songs, three remakes from the YLT back catalog, and nine covers, which range from the instantly recognizable (Hank Williams' \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,\" inspired by Al Green's version) to the thoroughly obscure (unless you're a Hoboken pop obsessive or a James McNew completist, \"Automatic Doom\" by the Special Pillows is probably not on your hit parade). Just as importantly, original Yo La Tengo guitarist Dave Schramm, who appeared on Fakebook, returned for the Stuff Like That There sessions, and while his style would have been a poor fit beside Ira Kaplan's clouds of six-string skronk that became a highlight of YLT's work from President Yo La Tengo onward, for stuff like this, Schramm's graceful sound, full of echo and clean single-note leads, meshes gloriously with Kaplan's implacable strum and the steady shuffle of bassist James McNew and drummer and vocalist Georgia Hubley. As \"quiet\" Yo La Tengo goes, like Fakebook this is top shelf, beautiful, and subtly joyous, and while the songs are well chosen and the performances are warm and passionate despite the low decibel level, the real secret weapon here is Georgia Hubley's vocals. Like Maureen Tucker singing \"After Hours,\" what Hubley lacks in range she more than makes up for in her ability to infuse a song with feeling, and from the heartache of \"My Heart's Not in It\" and the lover's kiss-off of \"Butchie's Tune\" to the sweetly fractured romanticism of \"Friday I'm in Love,\" Hubley's work beautifully demonstrates how much more less can be. If Stuff Like That There isn't as revelatory as Fakebook, it's a splendid, beguiling album that's perfectly suited for late nights and rainy afternoons, and a welcome reminder of one of the many, many things Yo La Tengo do so well. ~ Mark Deming",

        "summary": "Sublime's eponymous major-label debut arrived a few months after the band's leader, Brad Nowell, died tragically of a heroin overdose. As a show of sympathy, the album tended to be slightly overrated in some critical quarters, who claimed that Nowell was an exceptionally gifted lyricist and musical hybridist, but Sublime doesn't quite support those claims. The trio does have a surprising grace in its unabashedly traditionalist fusion of Californian hardcore punk, light hip-hop, and reggae. Switching between bracing hardcore and slow, sexy reggae numbers, Sublime display supple, muscular versatility and, on occasion, a gift for ingratiatingly catchy hooks, as on the hit single \"What I Got.\" What they don't have is the vision -- either lyrical or musical -- to maintain interest throughout the course of the entire album. Sublime sags when the band delves too deeply into their dub aspirations or when their lyrics slide into smirking humor. The low moments don't arrive that often -- by and large, the album is quite engaging -- but they happen frequently enough to make the record a demonstration of the band's blossoming ability, but not the fulfillment of their full potential. Of course, Nowell's death gives the record a certain pathos, but that doesn't make the album any stronger. [Sublime is also available in a release with added bonus tracks.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "For a while, Charli XCX seemed to be tiptoeing into the spotlight. After co-writing and singing on Icona Pop's smash  hit \"I Love It,\" her album True Romance -- which had a darker, indie-friendly sound -- earned more acclaim than sales. Her next big break came with another collaboration, 2014's inescapable \"Fancy,\" where she provided the sing-songy chorus to Iggy Azalea's brash verses. On Sucker, she keeps more of that hit-making swagger for herself, delivering attention-getting pop that's bold enough to ensure she isn't overshadowed by anybody. She makes her purpose clear with the album's title track, a musical middle finger to the clueless set to revved-up synths and stabbing guitars. It's a big change from the gothy pop of True Romance, though even on that album, XCX's hooks were undeniable. Sucker is also full of should-be hits, but these songs also show how creatively she fashions the shiniest parts of the '80s, '90s, 2000s, and 2010s into her own highly stylized sound. \"Famous\" bops along on a riff that nods to Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\"; there's a bit of Elastica in \"Breaking Up\"'s buzzsaw guitars and flirty put-downs; \"Caught in the Middle\" could be vintage Gwen Stefani; and \"Doing It\"'s retro dance-pop feels equally informed by XCX's own fascination with the '90s and HAIM's update on that decade. Similarly, Charli still exudes plenty of sass on Sucker, but the exact kind of attitude has changed. She retrofits some of True Romance's atmosphere on \"Boom Clap,\" turning it into a sparkly anthem to young love that seems more innocent than it actually is. If she was trying to keep up with the hip kids before, now she sounds like an older sister sharing her tricks on \"Break the Rules,\" where she's literally too cool for school. Anytime it feels like XCX may have oversimplified her sound -- like the notable absence of one of her finest singles, \"Superlove\" -- she proves otherwise. There's a realness to her writing no matter how shiny the album's surfaces are, and while these songs are influenced by the success she's had with others, she's saved her most personal songs for herself. It's hard to imagine any of her collaborators or contemporaries belting out a lyric like \"When I'm driving down the wrong side of the road, I feel like JFK you know\" with as much mischievous glee as Charli does on the standout \"London Queen\"; later, she states her independence, sexual and otherwise, on \"Body of My Own.\" From song to song, she bounces from hanging out in her friends' bedroom to flying on private jets, making both sound like the coolest possible thing to do. Sucker's mix of youth and sophistication is more than a little volatile, and sometimes it feels like XCX is still figuring out what really works for her music. Nevertheless, it succeeds as an introduction to Charli XCX the Pop Star while retaining her whip-smart songwriting and attitude. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "Since it has become fashionable to derisively refer to Wilco's music as \"Dad Rock,\" it seems fitting that Jeff Tweedy would cleverly point to his own dadness by making an album with one of his sons. Sukierae, credited to Tweedy, features Spencer Tweedy, Jeff's 18-year-old son, on drums and percussion, while the rest of the instruments (except for some keyboards and backing vocals) are handled by Jeff. This father and son bonding comes at a difficult time in their personal lives, as Susan Miller Tweedy -- Jeff's wife and Spencer's mom -- was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in early 2014. None of the songs on Sukierae deal directly with this sort of familial crisis, but there's a note of struggle and hope in songs like \"Wait for Love\" and \"Nobody Dies Anymore,\" while the opening lines of \"New Moon\" -- \"Well, I've always been certain nearly all of my life/One day I'd be your burden and you would be my wife\" -- clearly refer to the ways time and circumstance can change the balance of a relationship. But whatever the literal or metaphorical meaning of the lyrics on Sukierae, musically this album finds Jeff Tweedy stepping away from the grand-scale sound of Wilco for a set of songs that feel significantly more intimate and personal. Spencer's drumming certainly makes a difference; his style is solid but with an exploratory bent, sometimes throwing in rhythms and fills that recall hip-hop beats while elsewhere bringing out slightly prog-like colors on the toms and cymbals, and if he's not as precise as Wilco's Glenn Kotche, his percussion (which is played up strong in the mix) gives this music an organic sound that fits the songs well. As for Jeff, he's never been a virtuoso guitarist, but on Sukierae he gives himself more room to explore on his instruments than he has since his work with the side project Loose Fur, and his instrumental work, elemental but atmospheric, cuts to the core of these melodies, which are frequently downbeat but also quite beautiful. In their own low-key way, these songs sound like Jeff Tweedy's most passionate, heartfelt work since Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, and Sukierae is a powerful, emotionally naked work that gives him a chance to do things he likely couldn't have made work quite so well with his band. And if this is Dad Rock â¦ well, sometimes dads have stories worth hearing, and Sukierae shows that Jeff Tweedy more than qualifies. ~ Mark Deming",

        "summary": "Jeff Tweedy once blazed the trail for the American rock underground's embrace of its country and folk roots, but as the decade drew to a close he also began spearheading the return of classic pop; simply put, what once were fiddles on Wilco records became violins -- the same instrument, to be sure, but viewed with a radical shift in perception and meaning. While lacking the sheer breadth and ambition of the previous Being There, Summer Teeth is the most focused Wilco effort yet, honing the lessons of the last record to forge a majestic pop sound almost completely devoid of alt-country elements. The lush string arrangements and gorgeous harmonies of tracks like \"She's a Jar\" and \"Pieholden Suite\" suggest nothing less than a landlocked Brian Wilson, while more straightforward rockers like the opening \"I Can't Stand It\" bear the influence of everything from R&B to psychedelia. Still, for all of the superficial warmth and beauty of the record's arrangements, Tweedy's songs are perhaps his darkest and most haunting to date, bleak domestic dramas informed by recurring themes of alienation, adultery, and abuse -- even the sunniest melodies mask moments of devastating power. If Summer Teeth has a precedent, it's peak-era Band; the album not only possesses a similar pastoral sensibility, but like Robbie Robertson and company before them, Wilco seems directly connected to a kind of American musical consciousness, not only rejuvenating our collective creative mythology, but adding new chapters to the legend with each successive record. ~ Jason Ankeny",

        "summary": "Temples are four young lads from Kettering who for all purposes sound like they just popped in from 1967 after a short trip on a paisley-bedecked TARDIS. They don't miss a single sonic trick; from soaring 12-string jangle to backwards-tracked guitars, flowing vocal harmonies, swooning Mellotrons, and baroque organ interludes, they know their musical history like they lived through it. Their 2014 debut, Sun Structures, is a nostalgia trip for sure, while at the same time sounding totally modern too. The band's vocalist/guitarist, James Bagshaw, produced the album and he goes for a sound that's happily mired in the past, but has a cleanly scrubbed punch that gives the album some real power. For example, the drums have a kick that would have been hard to get in 1967 unless you recorded at EMI Studio Two with George Martin at the helm. Bagshaw and the rest of the band also prove to be masterful at layering sounds together, dropping parts in and out for dramatic effect, bringing in surprising bits of flair (like the harp on \"Keep in the Dark\"), conjuring up impressively diverse guitar tones, and generally making the kind of record bands wish they could have made back then. Many of Temples' contemporaries wish they could have made this record too, because not only does it sound amazing, but the songs are like a collection of hit singles mashed together in a 54-minute cavalcade of brilliant melodies, singable choruses, and mesmerizing rhythms. Chief among them is the album's first track, \"Shelter Song,\" which kicks things off in the clouds with a divine melody and some hilariously pretentious but sweet lyrics, and really lets you know right away that the band is doing something special. The rest of the album flows from trippy psych pop ballads (\"Move with the Season\") to gaily skipping, Donovan-esque rambles (\"Keep in the Dark\") to hard-as-granite blues stompers with heavy guitars (\"A Question Isn't Answered\") to poppy tracks that bubble like melted chocolate and have a hard-candy crunch (\"Mesmerise\") to epic-sounding, slowly unspooling psych jams (\"Test of Time\") as Temples merrily grab everything from the past that works and effortlessly makes it work for them. The only possible complaint one might have with the record is that everything sounds just right, that it's maybe too perfect of a re-creation of the past without enough of their own personality injected into the proceedings. In this case, though, Temples play with enough energy, Bagshaw sings with enough angelically pure emotion, and the overall project flows with enough sonic imagination that they easily avoid the charge. Sun Structures is an impressive debut that would be legendary now if it had been released in 1967; in 2014 it's merely the best psych pop around.

        "summary": "Kevin Barnes' seventh Of Montreal album continues in his traditional vein of toying and teasing our memories of '60s pop, fed through whichever other fad or fashion most appeals to him at the time. In this instance, it's \"21st century ADD electro-cinematic avant disco,\" which is a deliciously protracted way of saying quirky rhythms, lush harmonics, and a warm spot on the same side of the bed that the Polyphonic Spree occasionally share. The most deceptive angle to the album probably has to do with the titles -- it's unlikely whether the most obtuse mind could ever imagine tapping its toes to something called \"Wraith Pinned to the Mist (And Other Games),\" while \"Forecast Fascist Future\" simply shouldn't sound like a British Beach Boys, pebble-dashed with Ray Davies' finest harmonic daydreams, and then piped into a nursery where the infant Frank Zappa lays sleeping. Elsewhere, \"Our Spring Is Sweet, Not Fleeting\" may be little more than a minute long, but you live through great swathes of Rosemary's Baby while it's playing. To harp on about the \"obvious\" precedents that aging ears can pick out of Of Montreal's sonic stew, however, is to overlook all that is so savagely entertaining about their music (plus, it makes them sound like a High Llamas tribute band, which is unfair as well). Rather, Sunlandic Twins is an album to leave playing while you're going about your daily business. Then see how quickly you discover its 13 tracks burrowing so deeply into your skull that it's as though you'd lived with its jerking, burbling, and never less than transcendental swirlings for ever.

        "summary": "John Darnielle is a compulsive writer forever clutching his stomach as songs pour out uncontrollably into whatever recording device is in front of him. What sets him apart from other prolific artists in the indie rock world (Conor Oberst, Ryan Adams, Stephin Merritt) whose records and side projects can't keep up with the flow of their pens is his almost alarming gift for pairing quantity with quality. After dropping the devastating Tallahassee -- a record that followed in gory detail the imagined demise of a Florida couple's marriage -- in 2002, he turned his focus inward, taking an almost autobiographical stance on the follow-up, We Shall All Be Healed, a framework that is applied tenfold on the riveting The Sunset Tree. This is John Cougar Mellencamp's Scarecrow if it were set in southern California and narrated by Charles Bukowski. At the center is Darnielle's abusive stepfather, who slyly receives the album's dedication. He's a drunk, a misguided disciplinarian, and a lousy role model for the young artist who plies away his days in a haze of liquor-fueled misogyny, wistful romanticism, and good old-fashioned teen angst, always aware that each night will end in violence. Darnielle's talent for writing an engaging narrative is matched only by the succinctness of the music behind it. This is especially true on standout cuts like \"This Year,\" a near-perfect snapshot of youthful defiance with its rousing, last-road-trip-ever refrain of \"I am gonna make it through this year if it kills me,\" and \"Lion's Teeth,\" an uncomfortable moment of clarity that looks rage in both eyes without flinching, using a string-laden backbeat to up the suspense. Despite The Sunset Tree's white-knuckle subject matter and salt-in-the-wound imagery, it's surprisingly accessible. It's a gloves-off catharsis occurring in real time for the gifted singer/songwriter, and it leaves a mark on the listener as well. ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "Santana was still a respected rock veteran in 1999, but it had been years since he had a hit, even if he continued to fare well on the concert circuits. Clive Davis, the man who had signed Santana to Columbia in 1968, offered him the opportunity to set up shop at his label, Arista. In the tradition of comebacks and label debuts by veteran artists in the '90s, Supernatural, Santana's first effort for Arista, is designed as a star-studded event. At first listen, there doesn't seem to be a track that doesn't have a guest star, which brings up the primary problem with the album -- despite several interesting or excellent moments, it never develops a consistent voice that holds the album together. The fault doesn't lay with the guest stars or even with Santana, who continues to turn in fine performances. There's just a general directionless feeling to the record, enhanced by several songs that seem like excuses for jams, which, truth be told, isn't all that foreign on latter-day Santana records. Then again, the grooves often play better than the ploys for radio play, but that's not always the case, since Lauryn Hill's \"Do You Like the Way\" and the Dust Brothers-produced, Eagle-Eye Cherry-sung \"Wishing It Was\" are as captivating as the Eric Clapton duet, \"The Calling.\" But that just confirms that Supernatural just doesn't have much of a direction, flipping between traditional Santana numbers and polished contemporary collaborations, with both extremes being equally likely to hit or miss. That doesn't quite constitute a triumph, but the peak moments of Supernatural are some of Santana's best music of the '90s, which does make it a successful comeback.

This alone would be a hefty haul -- the set amounts to 14 albums released over the course of nearly three decades -- but for the dedicated there's a supplemental compilation called Additional Creations and Bonus Tracks, which rounds up stray songs and unheard cuts.

        "summary": "Arriving nearly two years after his punchy first single, \"From Nowhere,\" Liverpool song man Dan Croll finally launches his colorful and immaculately produced debut album, Sweet Disarray. Riding the ample buzz of \"From Nowhere\" along with its three subsequent singles and bearing the stamp of approval from Liverpool's most famous son, Sir Paul himself, the bar was set awfully high for Croll's first full-length release. For the most part, he manages to keep up, rounding out his pre-album offerings with a group of vibrant and melodic songs that range from keyboard-laden, modern indie in the Vampire Weekend mold to sunny Afro-pop-inspired guitar tunes. From a songwriting standpoint, it's a well-rounded collection of ably written and generally catchy pop songs with occasional nods to classic troubadours like that other famous Paul (Simon). At his most stripped-down, songs like the lovely closer \"Home\" and the enchanting title cut show a young singer/songwriter well schooled in the classics and finding a place to plant his own two feet. On the production end, songs like \"In/Out,\" \"Wanna Know,\" and \"Thinkin Aboutchu\" display an aesthetic of modern inventiveness blending together chimey riffs, warm synths, programmed beats, and more organic elements into compact, impressive arrangements that polish merely decent material into something a bit more sterling. Croll is no retro-minded classicist and he uses all the current tools at his disposal to make a thoroughly modern pop record while still keeping a close enough eye on his role as a songwriter. It's a tough trick to pull off, with many artists leaning too hard to one side or the other of the spectrum, but Sweet Disarray proves Croll has both a forward-looking experimentalism and pretty solid songwriting chops to boot. In spite of the extremely high expectations, he has managed a pretty neat debut that will please fans who have been waiting since his early singles. [Sweet Disarray was also released on LP.] ~ Timothy Monger",

        "summary": "Performance dynamo and chameleonic entertainment personality Robbie Williams made a rapid transformation -- from English football hooligan to dapper saloon singer -- for his fourth LP, Swing When You're Winning. Still, Williams' tribute to the great American songbook is a surprisingly natural fit with its intended target: '50s trad-pop patriarchs like Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. And just like those two loveable rogues, Williams has brawled and boozed in the past, but isn't afraid to wear his heart on his sleeve; in fact, he's one of the few modern pop stars to fully embrace affecting balladry and nuanced singing. Williams and longtime producer Guy Chambers are also extremely careful with their product, so it shouldn't be surprising that Swing When You're Winning has innumerable extra-musical touches to carry it over: the cover features Williams relaxing in the studio in a period suit; his contract with EMI enabled the addition of the treasured Capitol logo at the top of the sleeve, and several tracks were even recorded at the famed Capitol tower in Hollywood.\r\nFortunately, Williams is no less careful with his performances. Since he lacks the authoritative air of master crooners like Sinatra and Bing Crosby (along with the rest of humanity), he instead plays up his closer connections to the world of Broadway. His readings are dynamic and emotional -- sometimes a consequence of trying to put a new spin on these classics (six of the covers are Sinatra standards, three are Bobby Darin's). He also invited, with nearly universal success, a series of duet partners: Nicole Kidman for the sublime \"Somethin' Stupid,\" Jon Lovitz for the irresistibly catty \"Well, Did You Evah,\" Rupert Everett for \"They Can't Take That Away From Me,\" longtime Sinatra accompanist Bill Miller on \"One for My Baby,\" even Sinatra himself for a version of \"It Was a Very Good Year\" on which Williams takes the first two verses (over the 1965 arrangement), then bows out as Sinatra's original counsels him concerning the later stages of life. Though it may be an overly close tribute to a familiar original (like many of the songs here), Williams' considerable skills with expression and interpretation largely overwhelm any close criticism. He's definitely much better on the comedy songs, especially the hilarious \"Well, Did You Evah\" (originally a duet for Crosby and Sinatra in the 1956 film High Society). Lovitz's rounded tones and faux-affected airs are a spot-on interpretation of Brother Cros, while Williams' emulation of a boorish lug (\"That's a nice dress -- think I could talk her out of it?\") is nearly perfect as well. Though arranger Steve Sidwell hasn't done many charts (and those for the movies Moulin Rouge, Bridget Jones' Diary, and Romeo + Juliet), he also acquits himself nicely aping classic scores for \"One for My Baby\" and \"Beyond the Sea.\" The lone Robbie Williams original is \"I Will Talk and Hollywood Will Listen,\" a sweeping pipe-dream fantasy of true American superstardom for Britain's biggest pop star. It could happen, too; Pierce Brosnan surely isn't growing any younger. ~ John Bush",

        "summary": "The eponymous debut album from the Durham, North Carolina duo of Amelia Meath and Nick Sanborn, the former a soulful crooner and songwriter best known as a member of Appalachian indie folk trio Mountain Man and the latter a talented electronic producer and bass player for country-psych rockers Megafaun, couldn't sound any further from the duo's flagship projects. Emitting a heady and evocative blend of breezy, late-night laptop-pop and glitchy metropolitan folk, Sylvan Esso's sophisticated confections fall somewhere between the fractured tabletop buzz of Tune-Yards and the breezy indie pop cinematics of Feist. Standout cuts like \"Hey Mami,\" \"H.S.K.T.,\" and \"Coffee\" are a tad dark, a bit sexy, and undeniably hypnotic, but they're also accessible (and surprisingly danceable), due in large part to the duo's Southern locale and Meath's laid-back delivery and penchant for penning coy and colorful lyrics. Elsewhere, the seductive \"Dreamy Bruises\" prowls about on a sleek, arpeggiated Grimes-approved groove, the sparse, gospel-like closer \"Come Down\" skillfully pairs Mountain Man austerity with ambient pop, and the appropriately named \"Wolf\" builds to a howling chorus on the strength of a fat synth line, a spare acoustic guitar, and a flurry of ghostly electronic pings, but it's the aforementioned \"Coffee\" that provides the perfect summation of the duo's strengths. It's both club- and cafe-ready, artsy, cool, and elusive enough to woo the Williamsburg contingency, yet soulful and lightly sweetened with warm Southern honey. [Sylvan Esso was also released on LP.] ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "Tales of Mystery and Imagination is an extremely mesmerizing aural journey through some of Edgar Allan Poe's most renowned works. With the use of synthesizers, drums, guitar, and even a glockenspiel, Parsons' shivering effects make way for an eerie excursion into Poe's well-known classics. On the album's 1987 remix, the instrumental \"Dream Within a Dream\" has Orson Welles narrating in front of this wispy collaboration of guitars and keyboards (Welles also narrates \"Fall of the House of Usher: Prelude\"). The EMI vocoder is used throughout \"The Raven\" with the Westminster City School Boys Choir mixed in to add a distinct flair to its chamber-like sound. Parsons' expertise surrounds this album, from the slyness that prevails in \"(The System Of) Doctor Tarr and Professor Feather\" to the bodeful thumping of the drums that imitate a heartbeat on \"The Tell-Tale Heart.\" \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" is a lengthy but dazzling array of musicianship that keeps the album's persona intact, while enabling the listener to submerge into its frightening atmosphere. With vocalists Terry Sylvester, John Miles, and Eric Woolfson stretched across each track, this variety of different singing styles adds color and design to the album's air. Without any underlying theme to be pondered upon, Alan Parsons instead paints a vivid picture of one of the most alluring literary figures in history by musically reciting his most famous works in expert fashion. ~ Mike DeGagne",

        "summary": "Though they were the most highly touted new wave band to emerge from the CBGB's scene in New York, it was not clear at first whether Talking Heads' Lower East Side art rock approach could make the subway ride to the midtown pop mainstream successfully. The leadoff track of the debut album, Talking Heads: 77, \"Uh-Oh, Love Comes to Town,\" was a pop song that emphasized the group's unlikely roots in late-'60s bubblegum, Motown, and Caribbean music. But the \"Uh-Oh\" gave away the group's game early, with its nervous, disconnected lyrics and David Byrne's strained voice. All pretenses of normality were abandoned by the second track, as Talking Heads finally started to sound on record the way they did downtown: the staggered rhythms and sudden tempo changes, the odd guitar tunings and rhythmic, single-note patterns, the non-rhyming, non-linear lyrics that came across like odd remarks overheard from a psychiatrist's couch, and that voice, singing above its normal range, its falsetto leaps and strangled cries resembling a madman trying desperately to sound normal. Talking Heads threw you off balance, but grabbed your attention with a sound that seemed alternately threatening and goofy. The music was undeniably catchy, even at its most ominous, especially on \"Psycho Killer,\" Byrne's supreme statement of demented purpose. Amazingly, that song made the singles chart for a few weeks, evidence of the group's quirky appeal, but the album was not a big hit, and it remained unclear whether Talking Heads spoke only the secret language of the urban arts types or whether that could be translated into the more common tongue of hip pop culture. In any case, they had succeeded as artists, using existing elements in an unusual combination to create something new that still managed to be oddly familiar. And that made Talking Heads: 77 a landmark album. ~ William Ruhlmann",

Real fans have this stuff; there isn't anything else here in terms of bonuses or extra tracks warranting the purchase, so simply let it gather dust in the bin. ~ Thom Jurek",

        "summary": "Time has decreed that there will always be a fan base for old-school, scrappy-voiced rock & roll, and plenty of bands young and old, who'll provide it. Whether or not those bands have anything new to say is up for debate. Hailing from Pennsylvania's historic Lancaster County are the Districts, four young men with electric guitars, tube amps, passionate, raw vocals and a familiarly appealing sound. Landing somewhere between the rock & soul sound of Cold War Kids and the folk-pop throes of the Walkmen, the Districts distinguish their sound with a jangling alt-country bent and youthful enthusiasm. The group formed and released two independent EPs and a full-length album all while still attending high school. In interviews, the group's young age is not a topic they wish to dwell upon, but it's worth noting that they've managed to carve out an enviable semi-pro career with legit gigs, releases, and good press all before graduation. Their work ethic paid off in 2013 when they were picked up by Fat Possum Records, who pieced together this self-titled EP using a few standouts from the band's 2012 LP, Telephone, bookended by two new songs. Kicking off the set is \"Rocking Chair,\" an able, riffy jangle rocker, sung with sweaty abandon and featuring some nicely arranged group backing vocals. The middle three tracks, all plucked from their self-released LP, continue with the same sort of strummy, reverb-drenched indie rock as the opener. The slow-building \"Funeral Beds\" was an early success for the band when a live video of the song went viral on Reddit in 2012. The fifth and final track, \"Stay Open,\" shows a bit more range with a dynamic complexity that is rather lacking on the rest of the EP. The Districts' wheelhouse of soulful, midtempo guitar rock is a crowded field and, though well-played, their bluesy world-weariness begins to come across as unconvincing. This set is a solid introduction to what the band does and will likely garner them some new admirers, but now that the Districts have entered the indie big leagues, their next effort will need to show some more artistic development for the band to have legs. ~ Timothy Monger",

        "summary": "It's a commonly held opinion among fans and band alike that Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers' lone live album, 1986's Pack Up the Plantation, didn't quite capture the group at its peak, so there has been a long-standing need for another live set, which 2009's Live Anthology finally provides. Like its closest cousin, Bruce Springsteen's Live 1975-1985, Live Anthology almost overcompensates for the long wait by offering almost too much music, cherrypicking highlights from 1978 to 2007. In its simplest incarnation, Live Anthology is a super-affordable, four-disc box set running 48 tracks, which is eight cuts longer than Springsteen's box, plenty long enough for most fans, but in its deluxe version, there's an additional CD, plus two previously unreleased DVDs -- a 1978 New Years Eve concert from Santa Monica, a documentary called 400 Days shot during the Wildflowers tour -- a Blu-Ray edition of all 62 tracks on the five-CD version, a vinyl copy of the 1976 Official Live 'Leg LP, plus a book and lithograph, along with other assorted bonuses. Certainly, the deluxe edition lives up to its billing, offering enough extras to justify its price tag, but the standard edition is plenty generous as it is, serving up enough consistently strong music from throughout the decades, ranging from expert covers of Willie Dixon and the Grateful Dead to deep treasures from the Heartbreakers catalog. Apart from the tendency to favor performances that stretch on a little too long with jamming -- something that is a matter of taste, as some prefer energy to improvisations -- if there's any flaw to the set, it's how it goes out of its way to prove the band's consistency by skipping through the decades, letting a version of \"Louisiana Rain\" from 1972 sit next to a 1997 cover of \"Green Onions\" and \"Melinda\" from 2003. This certainly goes a long way to illustrating that Petty & the Heartbreakers always delivered the goods, but it's somewhat at the expense of forward momentum; it's hard not to wish that it was arranged chronologically, to be able to hear the raw energy give way to easy skill, but that's just nitpicking -- any way you look at it, this Live Anthology offers an overdose of prime rock & roll. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

Mixing hard rock and English folk music with classical influences, set to stream-of-consciousness lyrics so dense with imagery that one might spend weeks pondering their meaning -- assuming one feels the need to do so -- the group created a dazzling tour de force, at once playful, profound, and challenging, without overwhelming the listener. The original LP was the best-sounding, best-engineered record Tull had ever released, easily capturing the shifting dynamics between the soft all-acoustic passages and the electric rock crescendos surrounding them. ~ Bruce Eder",

        "summary": "The 2012 Mercury Prize winners begin their sophomore outing with the subversively titled \"Intro,\" a four-and-a-half-minute highlight reel of what's to come that pairs the monastic chanting that prefaced An Awesome Wave's first single, \"Fitzpleasure,\" with a pastiche of new age and worldbeat-blasted ambient pop that suggests Mogwai by way of Peter Gabriel's Real World studios circa 1990 -- it's both planetarium laser light show and art installation ready. The muted yet equally heady \"Arrival in Nara,\" all fingerpicked electric guitar and diffusive synths, and its more muscular yet no less monkish second half, \"Nara,\" do little to rein in the holistic atmosphere that's so decisively laid out in the remarkably potent This Is All Yours' opening moments, which makes the arrival of the punchy, carnally minded \"Every Other Freckle\" and the meaty, Anglo-Motown thump of \"Left Hand Free\" so thrilling, but hardly unexpected. After all, this is a band that proved with its debut that it can go from icy, distant, and often excruciatingly beautiful to downright feral at the crack of a snare drum (or pots and pans, as the group's humble, dorm room beginnings often required), and This Is All Yours does little to tarnish their reputation as choirboys with dark passengers. That penchant for edgy refinement, along with frontman Joe Newman's elastic voice, remains the band's most effective weapon, but it's hard to pinpoint where and when that magic occurs, as it's so effortlessly woven into the group's sound. It's somewhere in between the autumnal and apocalyptic, Miley Cyrus-sampling \"Hunger of the Pine,\" the bucolic, recorder-led \"Garden of England,\" and the oddly soulful, midnight-black posturing of \"The Gospel of John Hurt,\" and it gets under your skin, where it somehow manages to both hurt and heal. ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "Off the Wall was a massive success, spawning four Top Ten hits (two of them number ones), but nothing could have prepared Michael Jackson for Thriller. Nobody could have prepared anybody for the success of Thriller, since the magnitude of its success was simply unimaginable -- an album that sold 40 million copies in its initial chart run, with seven of its nine tracks reaching the Top Ten (for the record, the terrific \"Baby Be Mine\" and the pretty good ballad \"The Lady in My Life\" are not like the others). This was a record that had something for everybody, building on the basic blueprint of Off the Wall by adding harder funk, hard rock, softer ballads, and smoother soul -- expanding the approach to have something for every audience. That alone would have given the album a good shot at a huge audience, but it also arrived precisely when MTV was reaching its ascendancy, and Jackson helped the network by being not just its first superstar, but first black star as much as the network helped him. This all would have made it a success (and its success, in turn, served as a new standard for success), but it stayed on the charts, turning out singles, for nearly two years because it was really, really good. True, it wasn't as tight as Off the Wall -- and the ridiculous, late-night house-of-horrors title track is the prime culprit, arriving in the middle of the record and sucking out its momentum -- but those one or two cuts don't detract from a phenomenal set of music. It's calculated, to be sure, but the chutzpah of those calculations (before this, nobody would even have thought to bring in metal virtuoso Eddie Van Halen to play on a disco cut) is outdone by their success. This is where a song as gentle and lovely as \"Human Nature\" coexists comfortably with the tough, scared \"Beat It,\" the sweet schmaltz of the Paul McCartney duet \"The Girl Is Mine,\" and the frizzy funk of \"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing).\" And, although this is an undeniably fun record, the paranoia is already creeping in, manifesting itself in the record's two best songs: \"Billie Jean,\" where a woman claims Michael is the father of her child, and the delirious \"Wanna Be Startin' Something,\" the freshest funk on the album, but the most claustrophobic, scariest track Jackson ever recorded. These give the record its anchor and are part of the reason why the record is more than just a phenomenon. The other reason, of course, is that much of this is just simply great music.

        "summary": "Belle & Sebastian's first album, Tigermilk, was initially pressed in a quantity of 1,000 on their own label, Electric Honey Recordings. The record was intended to be the end result of Stuart Murdoch's music business school course, but it became an unexpected word-of-mouth sensation in England, and the LP quickly disappeared from shops. As a result, once the group's second album, If You're Feeling Sinister, became a hit, there were no copies of Tigermilk available for newly converted fans and it remained unheard by the majority of the group's audience. Those who have heard it say it is quite similar stylistically to If You're Feeling Sinister and the songs match that record's high standard. Tigermilk was re-released in 1999 to the delight of the often cultish fans of Belle & Sebastian. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Dave Brubeck's defining masterpiece, Time Out is one of the most rhythmically innovative albums in jazz history, the first to consciously explore time signatures outside of the standard 4/4 beat or 3/4 waltz time. It was a risky move -- Brubeck's record company wasn't keen on releasing such an arty project, and many critics initially roasted him for tampering with jazz's rhythmic foundation. But for once, public taste was more advanced than that of the critics. Buoyed by a hit single in altoist Paul Desmond's ubiquitous \"Take Five,\" Time Out became an unexpectedly huge success, and still ranks as one of the most popular jazz albums ever. That's a testament to Brubeck and Desmond's abilities as composers, because Time Out is full of challenges both subtle and overt -- it's just that they're not jarring. Brubeck's classic \"Blue Rondo Ã  la Turk\" blends jazz with classical form and Turkish folk rhythms, while \"Take Five,\" despite its overexposure, really is a masterpiece; listen to how well Desmond's solo phrasing fits the 5/4 meter, and how much Joe Morello's drum solo bends time without getting lost. The other selections are richly melodic as well, and even when the meters are even, the group sets up shifting polyrhythmic counterpoints that nod to African and Eastern musics. Some have come to disdain Time Out as its become increasingly synonymous with upscale coffeehouse ambience, but as someone once said of Shakespeare, it's really very good in spite of the people who like it. It doesn't just sound sophisticated -- it really is sophisticated music, which lends itself to cerebral appreciation, yet never stops swinging. Countless other musicians built on its pioneering experiments, yet it's amazingly accessible for all its advanced thinking, a rare feat in any art form. This belongs in even the most rudimentary jazz collection. [Time Out was re-released on LP in 2010.] ~ Steve Huey",

Instead, the Scottish singer/songwriter's self-released debut full-length bears haunting similarities to the likes of Nick Drake's Pink Moon, hardly the way to mainstream stardom no matter how many car commercials it inspires. Nearly a third of the album will be familiar to those who already have Murdoch's 2004 EP Four Songs, three-quarters of which is reprised here, including \"Orange Sky,\" the aforementioned small-screen favorite. (\"It's Only Fear\" is the sole track that didn't make the leap, insuring collector-geek status for the EP.) The remaining eight songs are, in the best possible sense, more of the same, and in the case of the first single \"Dream About Flying\" and the haunted opener \"All My Days,\" they surpass the older songs. Murdoch's murmuring, Drake-like vocals and John Martyn-style acoustic guitar are at the forefront of the album, with only the most minimal accompaniment. Detractors might dismiss Time Without Consequence as the work of a Cat Stevens for the Garden State generation, but there's a always a place for hushed intimacy and delicate folk-pop singer/songwriters, and Alexi Murdoch fills the bill without the mewling self-absorption of the emo contingent. ~ Stewart Mason",

        "summary": "With the opening kick of a simple but loud drum machine beat and multiple full-throttle guitar wails over the top, it quickly becomes apparent that John Frusciante has also given a swift kick to his heroin addiction. Hard drugs left the Red Hot Chili Peppers' guitarist derailed, deranged, and near death before an L.A. Weekly reporter detailed his frail state in a chilling story, moving some friends to help Frusciante check into a rehab center. He got off drugs and rejoined the Peppers in time to help Californication become a critical and popular success in 1999. In his time off from the band, however, Frusciante released two solo records, which he later admitted were made for drug money. Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt and Smile From the Streets You Hold displayed an intriguingly dark departure from the Peppers' polished funky punk. The scratchy and naked lo-fi ramblings reveled in the art of voyeuristic discomfort. And while some of the results displayed intense, edge-teetering freakouts, ragged beauty, or bleak intelligence -- celebrating the idea that the process and development of a song can sometimes be just as engaging as the \"finished\" product -- others simply unraveled into crumbs of little or no value. To Record Only Water for Ten Days, however, is made up of 15 \"legitimate\" songs. The whole is still quite simple -- stellar guitar work, impressive vocal range, drum machine, and minimal effects -- but it's a much healthier and \"together\" sound. Still a departure from the Peppers, To Record has an overall almost goth-like singer/songwriter vibe, at times colliding into rock catharsis. But Frusciante hasn't forgotten his shaky past, utilizing similarly abstract and slightly disturbed lyricism: \"Where you go doesn't matter/Cuz there will come a time/When time goes out the window/And you'll learn to drive out of focus/I'm you and if anything unfolds/It's supposed to.\" Although most fans will no doubt be relieved that Frusciante has pieced his life back together, appreciators of the \"falling apart\" aspect of his past work might be disappointed by To Record's more accessible, less collapsible sturdiness. Even the look of the record is excessively clean, with a simple two-color design and all-caps block letters. ~ Melissa Giannini",

        "summary": "For one brief moment, Dexy's exploded into America's consciousness -- and what a song to do it with! \"Come on Eileen\" combines ramalama rock & roll, soul delivery, and Celtic/country flavor into a perfect musical fusion and an irresistible U.K. and U.S. number one hit. The rest of the album is nearly as successful, with quite a few numbers that should have matched \"Come on Eileen\"'s fame. Given that song's obvious debt to Van Morrison's similar fusions, it's no surprise that Dexy's tipped their hat with a great cover of Morrison's \"Jackie Wilson Said,\" another big British single. Throughout the album, Rowland's distinct, unique voice takes the fore, but the revamped Dexy's lineup proves it was the original version's equal, if not better. Given that only trombonist Big Jimmy Patterson remained, and even then only for two tracks, recruiting a new band able to create the \"Celtic soul\" Rowland dreamed about turned out to be exactly the right move. Excellently produced by Rowland and the legendary Clive Langer/Alan Winstanley production team, Too-Rye-Ay sounds like an old soul revue recorded on-stage, no doubt an intentional goal. Other highlights include the opening jaunt \"The Celtic Soul Brothers,\" which just about says it all both in title and delivery; the slow swirl of \"All in All,\" and the vicious ballad \"Liars A to E.\" ~ Ned Raggett",

        "summary": "It's as easy to see why radio listeners loved Toto as it is to see why critics hated them. Toto's rock-studio chops allowed them to play any current pop style at the drop of a hi-hat: one minute prog rock, the next hard rock, the next funky R&B. It all sounded great, but it also implied that music-making took craft rather than inspiration and that the musical barriers critics like to erect were arbitrary. Then, too, Toto's timing couldn't have been much worse. They rode in during the middle of punk/new wave with its D.I.Y. aesthetic, and their sheer competence was an affront. Of course, there's always been an alternate history of popular music not available to rock critics (it's written in record stores and concert halls and on the radio), and in that story, Toto was a smash. Singles like \"I'll Supply the Love\" and \"Georgy Porgy\" (featuring Cheryl Lynn) made the charts, and \"Hold the Line\" hit the Top Ten and went gold. The members of Toto had already influenced the course of '70s popular music by playing on half the albums that came out of L.A. All they were doing with this album was going public.

        "summary": "It was do or die for Toto on the group's fourth album, and they rose to the challenge. Largely dispensing with the anonymous studio rock that had characterized their first three releases, the band worked harder on its melodies, made sure its simple lyrics treated romantic subjects, augmented Bobby Kimball's vocals by having other group members sing, brought in ringers like Timothy B. Schmit, and slowed down the tempo to what came to be known as \"power ballad\" pace. Most of all, they wrote some hit songs: \"Rosanna,\" the old story of a lovelorn lyric matched to a bouncy beat, was the gold, Top Ten comeback single accompanying the album release; \"Make Believe\" made the Top 30; and then, surprisingly, \"Africa\" hit number one ten months after the album's release. The members of Toto may have more relatives who are NARAS voters than any other group, but that still doesn't explain the sweep they achieved at the Grammys, winning six, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year (for \"Rosanna\"). Predictably, rock critics howled, but the Grammys helped set up the fourth single, \"I Won't Hold You Back,\" another soft rock smash and Top Ten hit. As a result, Toto IV was both the group's comeback and its peak; it remains a definitive album of slick L.A. pop for the early '80s and Toto's best and most consistent record. Having made it, the members happily went back to sessions, where they helped write and record Michael Jackson's Thriller. [A remastered, limited-edition CD was released in 2014.] ~ William Ruhlmann",

        "summary": "Toulouse Street was the album by which most of their fans began discovering the Doobie Brothers, and it has retained a lot of its freshness over the decades. Producer Ted Templeman was attuned to the slightly heavier and more Southern style the band wanted to work toward on this, their second album, and the results were not only profitable -- including a platinum record award -- but artistically impeccable. Toulouse Street is actually pretty close in style and sound at various points to what the Eagles were doing during the same period, except that the Doobies threw jazz and R&B into the mix, as well as country, folk, and bluegrass elements, and (surprise!) ended up just about as ubiquitous as the Eagles in peoples' record collections, especially in the wake of the singles \"Listen to the Music\" and \"Jesus Is Just Alright.\" But those two singles represented only the tip of the iceberg in terms of what this group had to offer, as purchasers of the album discovered even on the singles -- both songs appear here in distinctly longer versions, with more exposition and development, and in keeping with the ambitions that album cuts (even of popular numbers) were supposed to display in those days. Actually, \"Listen to the Music\" (written by Tom Johnston) offers subtle use of phasing and other studio tricks that make its seemingly earthy, laid-back approach some of the most complex and contrived of the period. Johnston's \"Rockin' Down the Highway\" shows the band working at a higher wattage and moving into Creedence Clearwater Revival territory, while \"Mamaloi\" was Patrick Simmons' laid-back Caribbean idyll, and the title tune (also by Simmons) is a hauntingly beautiful ballad. The band then switches gears into swamp rock for \"Cotton Mouth\" and takes a left turn into the Mississippi Delta for a version of Sonny Boy Williamson II's \"Don't Start Me Talkin'\" before shifting into a gospel mode with \"Jesus Is Just Alright.\" Johnston's nearly seven-minute \"Disciple\" was the sort of soaring, bluesy hard rock workout that led to the group's comparison to the Allman Brothers Band, though their interlocking vocals were nearly as prominent as their crunching, surging double lead guitars and paired drummers. And it all still sounds astonishingly bracing decades later; it's still a keeper, and one of the most inviting and alluring albums of its era. ~ Bruce Eder",

        "summary": "We Were Evergreen's full-length debut, 2014's Towards, is a buoyant, delicately experimental mix of folk-pop and eclectic electronic music. With a sound based around the melodic drive of guitars and keyboards as well as ukulele and harmonized vocals, it would easy to dismiss the Parisian-born/U.K.-based band as purveyors of friendly, light indie pop. That is, of course, if their album wasn't so accomplished and, in its own way, adventurous. Here, We Were Evergreen showcase their knack for delivering engaging, literate lyrics and jazzy, intricate arrangements that somehow find a middle ground between Tom Tom Club-esque '80s new wave and Fleet Foxes-influenced harmonized folk, not to mention Death Cab for Cutie's poignant and twee balladry. Lead vocalist/guitarist Michael Liot has a pleasant, clear-toned style that brings to mind frontmen of such similarly inclined acts as Bombay Bicycle Club's Jack Steadman and Vampire Weekend's Ezra Koenig. Of course, as he often harmonizes vocals with his bandmates, keyboardist Fabienne DÃ©barre and bassist William Serfass, much of Towards has more of a group-oriented feel. Musically, the group shifts from melodic, Squeeze-influenced blue-eyed soul (\"False Start\"), to dancey, synthy Afro-pop (\"Daughters\"), to loungy midtempo dance cuts (\"Best Thing\") with easy aplomb. Elsewhere, we get the poignant romance of tracks like \"Overnight\" and the sugary exuberance of the whistle and clap-heavy \"Tambourine Like a Crown.\" Ultimately, on Towards, We Were Evergreen have moved slightly left of the indie pop center and achieved something quite interesting and enjoyable. ~ Matt Collar",

It features his first three studio albums -- including his debut, which has been debated by critics since it appeared -- along with Transformer and Berlin, and then gets filled out with the sloppy Sally Can't Dance and the highly underrated Coney Island Baby. This is a treat for fans who only have Transformer and possibly Berlin, since these sets contain completely remastered discs with bonus cuts at a very affordable price, making it almost inexcusable not to go deeper into an artist like Reed. Highly recommended. ~ Thom Jurek",

        "summary": "Midlake's second album is a departure from their lo-fi, psychedelic pop-influenced debut. The Trials of Van Occupanther jumps with both feet into the '70s of Laurel Canyon troubadours and soft rock balladeers. It jumps like Bob Beamon right past any other current bands treading similar ground and jumps back into time, becoming one of the best examples of the sound and style you'll ever hear, date of release notwithstanding. The first thing you notice on the album is the stunning vocal harmonies; you might think you dropped in an America disc by mistake. (The best record America ever did, that is.) Tim Smith has the kind of voice you know could be a glass-shattering instrument on par with that of Buckley or Wainwright, but he keeps it dialed down to an intimate scale, which is a wise decision. His vocals bleed melancholy honesty, and the way it combines with Eric Pulido's voice will raise goose bumps. The arrangements provide a perfect bed for the vocals, with cottony layers of acoustic guitars and strings, gentle horns, restrained drums, and lyrical piano combining beautifully. The occasional surprises are effective, especially when they use some of the corniest synth sounds heard since Jan Hammer unstrapped his keytar for the last time, on \"We Gathered in Spring\" and \"It Covers the Hillside.\" All of which is nice but isn't worth much without songs. Fortunately, Midlake writes unerringly tuneful melodies and thoughtful lyrics about topics other than love and introspection, and lays down plenty of gentle hooks. Nothing that you'll be singing in the shower for days at a time, but each song goes down smoothly and they add up to make The Trials of Van Occupanther a very pleasant, maybe even exciting in a restrained way, listening experience. You'll certainly find yourself reaching for it more often than you might expect; indeed, it has lasting power that many records that sound so good on first listen lack. Midlake might be stuck in the '70s, but they make it sound like the best place on earth. [A Japanese version included bonus tracks.] ~ Tim Sendra",

        "summary": "Singer, songwriter, and producer John Newman broke through with lead vocals on two 2012 U.K. hits by Rudimental. He presented himself as a soul-inspired shouter wise beyond his years. The following May, he released his debut solo single, \"Love Me Again\" -- cathartic, bulky, modern soul outfitted with the works, including a racing breakbeat, a furiously played piano riff, darting and beaming horns, singing strings, a screaming chorus, and even a little wriggling guitar that recalled the Supremes' \"You Keep Me Hanging On.\" In the U.K., it went to number one and went platinum, and the follow-up single, the slightly less forceful \"Cheating,\" peaked at number nine. The ensuing album, Tribute, would presumably offer those hits and more of Newman's all-out, ear-splitting breakup songs. Does it ever. If Newman didn't have his voice, used almost exclusively for in-the-red confrontations and testimonies, the outlet for his grief might be something equally extreme, like skimboarding, street luge, or some form of demolition work. As one line in \"Runnin'\" goes, \"I'm a hurricane that ain't stoppin'.\" While, at just short of 50 minutes, Tribute is concise by the early-2010s standard, its unflagging succession of belters is both impressive and fatiguing, delivered with a supreme level of grieving conviction and hefty productions seemingly designed for the sake of filling stadiums and megachurches. In small doses, Newman's work here provides quite an impassioned jolt, but as the songs continue to chug and careen, it begins to sound more like a bludgeoning, or an elaborate, combative response to being asked to tone it down a little.

        "summary": "\"The Game Has Changed\" is the name of one of the tracks on Daft Punk's score to Tron: Legacy, and it also fits Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo's music for the film. When it was announced that the duo would score the sequel to one of sci-fi's most visionary movies, it seemed like the perfect fit: Their sleek, neon-tipped, playful aesthetic springs from their love of late-'70s and early-'80s pop culture artifacts like Tron. However, Tron: Legacy takes a much darker, more serious approach than the original film and Daft Punk follows suit, delivering soaring and ominous pieces that sound more like modern classical music than any laser tag-meets-roller disco fantasies fans may have had. Tron: Legacy's legitimacy as a score may surprise listeners unaware of Bangalter's fine work on 2003's Irreversible; while that score actually hews closer to Daft Punk's sound, it showed his potential for crafting music beyond the duo's usual scope. Working with the London Orchestra, Bangalter and de Homem-Christo fuse electronic and orchestral motifs seamlessly and strikingly. \"The Game Has Changed\" may be the most dramatic example: It starts with a wistful wisp of melody that sounds like a ghost in the machine, then swells of strings and brass and buzzsaw electronics submerge but never quite overtake it. Elsewhere, \"Recognizer\"'s pulsing horns and synths and \"The Son of Flynn\"'s arpeggios and strings are so tightly knit that they finish each others' phrases. Daft Punk get in a few clever nods to Wendy Carlos' Tron score, from \"The Grid\"'s blobby analog synth tones to \"Adagio for Tron\"'s mournful sense of lost wonder. However, for most of Tron: Legacy, they're concerned with pushing boundaries. It's not until the score's second half that the duo's more typical sound emerges on \"Derezzed\"'s filter-disco and on \"End of the Line,\" where witty 8-bit sounds evoke '80s video games. These tracks come as welcome relief from the tension Daft Punk ratchets up on almost every other piece, particularly \"Rectifier\" and \"C.L.U.\" Encompassing the past, present, and future of sci-fi scores, Tron: Legacy feels like it grew and mutated from its origins the same way the film's world did. Without a doubt, it's a game-changer for Daft Punk. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "More than any other Fleetwood Mac album, Tusk is born of a particular time and place -- it could only have been created in the aftermath of Rumours, which shattered sales records, which in turn gave the group a blank check for its next album. But if they were falling apart during the making of Rumours, they were officially broken and shattered during the making of Tusk, and that disconnect between bandmembers resulted in a sprawling, incoherent, and utterly brilliant 20-track double album. At the time of its release, it was a flop, never reaching the top of the charts and never spawning a true hit single, despite two well-received Top Ten hits. Coming after the monumental Rumours, this was a huge disappointment, but the truth of the matter is that Fleetwood Mac couldn't top that success no matter how hard they tried, so it was better for them to indulge themselves and come up with something as unique as Tusk. Lindsey Buckingham directed both Fleetwood Mac and Rumours, but he dominates here, composing nearly half the album, and giving Christine McVie's and Stevie Nicks' songs an ethereal, floating quality that turns them into welcome respites from the seriously twisted immersions into Buckingham's id. This is the ultimate cocaine album -- it's mellow for long stretches, and then bursts wide open in manic, frantic explosions, such as the mounting tension on \"The Ledge\" or the rampaging \"That's Enough for Me,\" or the marching band-driven paranoia of the title track, all of which are relieved by smooth, reflective work from all three songwriters. While McVie and Nicks contribute some excellent songs, Buckingham owns this record with his nervous energy and obsessive production, winding up with a fussily detailed yet wildly messy record unlike any other. This is mainstream madness, crazier than Buckingham's idol Brian Wilson and weirder than any number of cult classics. Of course, that's why it bombed upon its original release, but Tusk is a bracing, weirdly affecting work that may not be as universal or immediate as Rumours, but is every bit as classic. As a piece of pop art, it's peerless. [Tusk was remastered and re-released on CD in 2015.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Since American Fool illustrated that John Cougar was becoming an actual songwriter, it's only proper that he reclaimed his actual last name, Mellencamp, for the follow-up, Uh-Huh. After all, now that he had success, he wanted to be taken seriously, and Uh-Huh reflects that in its portraits of brokenhearted life in the Midwest and its rumbling undercurrent of despair. Although his lyrics still have the tendency to be a little too vague, they are more effective here than ever before, as is his music; he might not have changed his style at all -- it's still a fusion of the Stones and Springsteen -- except that he now knows how to make it his own. Uh-Huh runs out of steam toward the end, but the first half -- with the dynamic rocker \"Crumblin' Down,\" his best protest song, \"Pink Houses,\" the punky \"Authority Song,\" the melancholy \"Warmer Place to Sleep,\" and the garage rocker \"Play Guitar\" -- makes the record his first terrific album. [Uh-Huh was re-released on LP in 2016.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Ultimate Painting is a very simpatico collaboration between James Hoare of Veronica Falls and Jack Cooper of Mazes. The two guitarists met while their groups were touring and decided to get together to make some resolutely analog music. Sometimes when people work apart from their main bands, they decide to try out new things. Not so much in this case. Hoare brings the restrained rhythmic punch and directness of his band; Cooper brings the interlocking guitars and songcraft of his. They mix these elements together in a super-relaxed and calm fashion that works a treat. With the tow trading off lead vocals, the songs are usually very Velvet Underground-inspired, simple and relatively free of adornment beyond the occasional one-finger piano fill or organ chord. The lack of busy arrangements suits them well and the record sounds exactly like what it was, a couple of friends hanging out and recording some songs. Alternating between quiet ballads that chime and whisper and brisk uptempo songs that bounce along like feet pounding the sidewalk, the songs are all catchy in various ways. The hookiest is the rambling, shaggy-dog tale \"Central Park Blues,\" which sounds like Dylan fronting the Velvets, but the title track isn't far behind with its lovely \"oh oh\" backings and twinkling guitar leads. Hoare and Cooper sound completely at home working together and their strengths as musicians play off each other in perfect harmony. It's rare that off-the-cuff collaborations work so well, so they should be celebrated when they do. Maybe it speaks to Hoare's collaborative abilities since his work with Max Claps in his other side project Proper Ornaments is just as good. Ultimate Painting may not reach the commercial heights of either guy's main band, but it is fully the equal and in some ways more interesting. Certainly if you're a fan of Veronica Falls or Mazes, you'll want to check this out right away. ~ Tim Sendra",

        "summary": "Given the White Stripesâ reputation for powerful concerts, itâs a little surprising that they waited until more than a decade into their career to release a live album. However, Under Great White Northern Lights was worth the wait: While nothing can really replace seeing the band live, this set captures most of their riveting on-stage presence. The album was recorded during the Stripesâ 2007 Canadian tour, which was such a special experience for them that they chronicled it with a DVD as well. The band was touring in support of that yearâs Icky Thump, and the Scottish and Celtic motifs that are woven throughout that album pop up here, too, from the bagpipes intro to a brisk version of âLittle Ghostâ that sounds almost like a reel. Like most White Stripes concerts, Under Great White Northern Lights features an even-handed mix of early songs and newer ones -- Jack and Meg White go way back for incendiary takes on âLetâs Shake Handsâ and âWhen I Hear My Name,â which sound right at home next to the lunging âIcky Thumpâ and âIâm Slowly Turning into You.â The album opens with four furious rockers that show just how primal the duo is live -- on âBlack Mathâ and a breathless âBlue Orchidâ they sound like they can barely keep up with the energy flowing through them -- but many of Under Great White Northern Lightsâ brightest moments happen when they slow down. Jack and Meg settle into a groove on â300 MPH Torrential Outpour Bluesâ that makes the song fresher than it was on Icky Thump, while a particularly stunning version of âThe Union Forever,â with extra-desperate vocals from Jack surrounded by a swelling, horror-movie organ, just might be the albumâs standout. The Stripes also include plenty of favorites, including âJolene,â a bluesy âFell in Love with a Girl,â a singalong âI Just Donât Know What to Do With Myself,â and a bruising âSeven Nation Armyâ as the finale, all of which capture the kind of show the band puts on for their fans. Since a big part of the Stripesâ live show also rests on their visuals, the Under Great White Northern Lights DVD gives the complete experience, but this album is satisfying enough to make it a must for most fans. ~ Heather Phares",

        "summary": "Eric Clapton's live performance on MTV's strip-down-the-rockers show allowed the heavily blues-influenced guitarist a chance to show off another, underrated side of his talent: his voice. It's especially interesting to hear Clapton in an acoustic setting, because he made his mark as one of the early proponents of high-decibel rock. Here, sorting through numerous blues standards by the likes of Robert Johnson and Leadbelly, Clapton gives a lesson in technique, style, and musical passion. His own newer material allows him to stretch and play, while the heavily grooved, slowed-down remake of his classic \"Layla\" is the essential standout. \"Tears in Heaven,\" a moving tribute to his son's passing, is emotionally raw, yet stylistically smooth; a difficult task to achieve. Stripping down the music of an artist as technically proficient and historically based as Eric Clapton was a stroke of genius. Hence, it's no surprise that the result, Unplugged, is brilliant as well. ~ Rovi Staff",

Listeners who are put off by the robe-wearing Polyphonic Spree's cultish glazed-eye self-help anthems or cringe when they hear the Mamas & the Papas' \"Young Girls Are Coming to the Canyon\" would be advised to get off the magic bus early, as Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros have crafted a love letter to Laurel Canyon and all of its quasi-mystic juju that is as infuriatingly contrived and retro as it is forward-thinking and majestic. Formed in 2007 by Ima Robot frontman Alex Ebert, the mammoth 11-piece outfit embraces \"the Summer of Love\" with enough period beards, fonts, and Eastern mysticism to launch a thousand \"Magical Mystery Tours,\" but despite all of the analog equipment and peacenik grandstanding, standout tracks like \"Home,\" \"Desert Song,\" and the aforementioned \"40 Day Dream\" sweep you up in their grandeur like a patchouli tornado and dare you to take your clothes off and jump in the lake with them. ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "Uprising would be the final studio album featuring Bob Marley & the Wailers to be released during Marley's lifetime. Prophetically, it also contains some of the band's finest crafted material, as if they were cognizant that this would be their final outing. The album's blend of religious and secular themes likewise creates a very powerful and singular quest for spirituality in a material world. Although it is argued that an album's graphic design rarely captures the essence of the work inside, the powerful rebirthing image of a rock solid Marley emerging with his arms raised in triumph could not be a more accurate visual description of the musical jubilation within. Musically, the somewhat staid rhythms often synonymous with reggae have been completely turned around to include slinky and liquid syncopation. \"Work,\" \"Pimper's Paradise,\" and the lead-off track \"Coming in From the Cold\" are all significant variations on the lolloping Rasta beat. The major difference is the sonic textures that manipulate and fill those patterns. The inventive and unique guitar work of Al Anderson -- the only American member of the original Wailers -- once again redefines the role of the lead electric guitar outside of its standard rock & roll setting. \"Zion Train\" is awash in wah-wah-driven patterns creating an eerie, almost ethereal backdrop against Marley's lyrics, which recollect images from Peter Tosh's \"Stop That Train\" all the way back on Marley & the Wailers' international debut Catch a Fire. The final track on the original pressing of Uprising is \"Redemption Song.\" Never has an artist unknowingly written such a beautiful and apropos living epitaph. The stark contrast from the decidedly electric and group-oriented album to this hauntingly beautiful solo acoustic composition is as dramatic as it is visionary. Less than a year after the release of Uprising, Marley would succumb to cancer. The 2001 \"Definitive Remaster\" version of Uprising contains the band version of \"Redemption Song\" and the 12\" mix of \"Could You Be Loved.\" [Uprising was re-released on LP in 2015.] ~ Lindsay Planer",

        "summary": "It wasn't noted much at the time, but founding keyboardist Jesse Carmichael sat out Maroon 5's 2012 album Overexposed -- a circumstance that just happened to coincide with Adam Levine capitalizing on his Voice-fueled stardom. Overexposed and over-filled with guest producers and songwriters drafted to compensate for the absent Carmichael, rapper Wiz Khalifa, reliable Swedish hitmakers Max Martin & Shellback, and icy OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder gave the group a steely sleekness to suit contemporary charts. Some of this is retained on V, the 2014 record that marks Carmichael's return to the group, partially because all those guests save Khalifa return for a second helping. The absence of the rapper suggests Maroon 5 aren't quite as concerned with sounding youthful as they were last time around, which is generally true. Some tracks maintain the glossy veneer that overwhelmed Overexposed -- not entirely a surprise with Martin billed as the record's executive producer -- and, despite some unnecessary vocal processing on Levine scattered throughout the record, these are largely the ones featuring returning guests: Tedder co-writes and co-produces the album's lead single, \"Maps,\" a song where Levine's Sting mannerisms steamroll the hooks,\" while Shellback helms \"Animals,\" \"In Your Pocket,\" and \"Feelings,\" with all but the last placing emphasis on brittle beats. Elsewhere, the vibe shifts slightly back to the soulful pop that's remained at Maroon 5's core since the beginning, here given an ever so slight maturation to balance the modern moves heard on the rest of the record. Sometimes, the group achieves a delicate balance between the two extremes -- \"It Was Always You,\" \"New Love,\" and the aforementioned \"Feelings\" -- but the best moments on V are when Maroon 5 embrace the tuneful, slightly soulful adult contemporary pop band they've always been, as they do on \"Sugar,\" \"Coming Back for You,\" and the Gwen Stefani duet \"My Heart Is Open.\" [A 2015 Deluxe Edition added four bonus tracks.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "The sophomore album from Isle of Wight sibling duo Champs, 2015's Vamala beautifully showcases the group's thoughtful, melodic mix of folk and indie pop. Once again relying on the songwriting talents of brothers Michael and David Champion, Vamala finds Champs picking up the musical threads begun with their 2014 debut, Down Like Gold. As with that album, Vamala is full of the brothers' harmony-driven compositions, which bring to mind the literate '60s acoustic style of Simon & Garfunkel (\"Roll Me Out\"), as well as soulful, sophisti-folk '80s groups like the Beautiful South (\"3,000 Miles\"). Vamala also fits nicely alongside the works of such similarly inclined contemporaries Vampire Weekend and Foster the People. Whereas Down Like Gold was recorded in a Victorian-era water tower-turned-recording studio on the Isle of Wight, though, Champs relocated to London for Vamala   to work with French producer Dimitri Tikovoi. Having previously helmed productions for such non-folk leaning artists as Placebo and Charli XCX, Tikovoi might not appear at first as a good fit for Champs' specific brand of ruminative, delicate pop. That said, the choice works and Tikovoi has helped craft a companion piece to Down Like Gold that frames Champs' lyrical, acoustic style with judicious bits of electronica, fuzzy keyboards, and echoey percussion. The production works especially well on cuts like \"Sophia\" and \"Running,\" where Tikovoi's approach lends buoyancy to Michael's cherubic lead vocal croon. Elsewhere, Champs deliver a handful of cinematic anthems, including \"Desire\" and \"The Balfron Tower,\" which, much like the duo's island home, are at once breezy and haunting.

        "summary": "Upon first release, the Velvet Underground's self-titled third album must have surprised their fans nearly as much as their first two albums shocked the few mainstream music fans who heard them. After testing the limits of how musically and thematically challenging rock could be on Velvet Underground & Nico and White Light/White Heat, this 1969 release sounded spare, quiet, and contemplative, as if the previous albums documented some manic, speed-fueled party and this was the subdued morning after. (The album's relative calm has often been attributed to the departure of the band's most committed avant-gardist, John Cale, in the fall of 1968; the arrival of new bassist Doug Yule; and the theft of the band's amplifiers shortly before they began recording.) But Lou Reed's lyrical exploration of the demimonde is as keen here as on any album he ever made, while displaying a warmth and compassion he sometimes denied his characters. \"Candy Says,\" \"Pale Blue Eyes,\" and \"I'm Set Free\" may be more muted in approach than what the band had done in the past, but \"What Goes On\" and \"Beginning to See the Light\" made it clear the VU still loved rock & roll, and \"The Murder Mystery\" (which mixes and matches four separate poetic narratives) is as brave and uncompromising as anything on White Light/White Heat. This album sounds less like the Velvet Underground than any of their studio albums, but it's as personal, honest, and moving as anything Lou Reed ever committed to tape. ~ Mark Deming",

        "summary": "Bert Kaempfert may have signed and lost the Beatles, but this CD is a reminder that he never lacked for hit records of his own, and had his own influence on popular culture around the world. The Very Best of Bert Kaempfert isn't quite a comprehensive collection of Kaempfert's hits, but it will have special resonances to listeners of a certain age group, and it covers a few bases that would be missed by a strict adherence to chart placements. In addition to the expected hits such as \"Wonderland by Night,\" \"Three O'Clock in the Morning,\" \"Spanish Eye (Moon Over Naples),\" \"Danke Schon,\" and \"Red Roses for a Blue Lady,\" the producers have included several non-charting singles of high quality, such as \"L-O-V-E (Love)\" and a handful of key representative LP tracks, among them \"Magic Trumpet (Happy Trumpeter),\" to illustrate the breadth of Kaempfert's work. Also notable is trio of tracks whose main recognition came from their use as incidental music -- \"Afrikaan Beat\" was a hit in its own right but beyond that, for decades, it turned up as a piece of bridge music used by New York-area children's television host Sandy Becker as a lead-in for segments, and was used for years after as transition music to news items on New York radio; \"That Happy Feeling,\" similarly, was used by Becker as background music for many of his crazier and more memorable dance sequences on his show, and turned up for years afterward on WNEW-TV as incidental background music; and \"A Swingin' Safari,\" in a cover by Billy Vaughn, was adapted as the theme to NBC's The Match Game show. Also featured are Kaempfert's own versions of his two contributions to Frank Sinatra's repertory, \"Strangers in the Night\" and \"The World We Knew (Over and Over).\" The sound is excellent -- everything is crisp and clean, the trumpet sounds like it's about three feet from the listener -- and the annotation and discography information are also very thorough. ~ Bruce Eder",

Released in 1990, The Very Best of Supertramp went a step further, arguably bettering this release by adding or supplanting a song or two, but casual fans are guaranteed to get their money's worth with either one.

        "summary": "Swedish folksinger JosÃ© GonzÃ¡lez's third full-length album, 2015's Vestiges & Claws, is a deceptively uncomplicated, poetic, and utterly poignant work. Coming seven years after his last album, the superb and similarly introspective In Our Nature, Vestiges & Claws finds GonzÃ¡lez in a deeply thoughtful state of mind ruminating over such timely albeit universal themes as religion vs. science, the relatively brief length of our lives on Earth, and the heartbreaking complexities of human relationships. Largely recorded at his home studio, with final touches done at the Svenska Grammofonstudion in Gothenburg, the album features GonzÃ¡lez singing and accompanying himself on acoustic guitar with a spare amount of backing percussion, flute, and vocals throughout. While that might sound limiting, GonzÃ¡lez is a musical universe unto himself, employing a fluid fingerpicking style that can sound as tiny as a whisper one second and as big as an orchestra the next. He also writes songs with a such a gorgeous harmonic palette, full of dichotomous suspended chords and lush minor/major juxtapositions, that your ears are never hungry for musical nourishment. Drawing, as he has done in the past, upon such '60s and '70s influences as Nick Drake, Robert Wyatt, and others, GonzÃ¡lez often sounds like an echo of the past, while his lyrical subject matter remains utterly current. Just as he supplies plenty of instrumental food for thought, GonzÃ¡lez proffers an abundance of substantive, existential lyrics. These are incredibly moving songs full of bittersweet asides that strike you at first with their haiku-like simplicity, only to draw you deeper into GonzÃ¡lez's iceberg of ideas. And while he addresses these ideas explicitly in \"What Will,\" questioning \"What will it be? Our legacy/Faith in dogma or reasoning,\" elsewhere he is more imagistic and opaque. On \"Leaf Off/The Cave,\" he turns the biblical Adam and Eve story upon itself, singing \"Why can't you/Take the leaf off your mouth/Now that you/Have the facts on your side/Take a moment to reflect who we are.\" Ultimately, it's this ability to stop you in your tracks and hold you with the warmth of his voice as you contemplate your existence that makes Vestiges & Claws such an arresting, uplifting joy. ~ Matt Collar",

Once again working with executive producer Alex Da Kid (Imagine Dragons, Nicki Minaj, Eminem), VHS follows up the group's previous Alex Da Kid-produced EPs, including 2013's Love Songs Drug Songs and 2014's The Reason. As with those releases, VHS showcases the talents of lead singer/songwriter Sam Harris, keyboardist Casey Harris, and guitarist Noah Feldsuh. Featured on VHS are several guest collaborations, including the previously released \"Jungle\" with Jamie N Commons and \"Fear\" with Imagine Dragons. Also included on VHS is the hit single \"Renegades.\" ~ Matt Collar",

        "summary": "In a word, stunning. Perhaps an odd word to use given that Violator continued in the general vein of the previous two studio efforts by Depeche Mode: Martin Gore's upfront lyrical emotional extremism and knack for a catchy hook filtered through Alan Wilder's ear for perfect arrangements, ably assisted by top English producer Flood. Yet the idea that this record would both dominate worldwide charts, while song for song being simply the best, most consistent effort yet from the band could only have been the wildest fantasy before its release. The opening two singles from the album, however, signaled something was up. First was \"Personal Jesus,\" at once perversely simplistic, with a stiff, arcane funk/hip-hop beat and basic blues guitar chords, and tremendous, thanks to sharp production touches and David Gahan's echoed, snaky vocals. Then \"Enjoy the Silence,\" a nothing-else-remains-but-us ballad pumped up into a huge, dramatic romance/dance number, commanding in its mock orchestral/choir scope. Follow-up single \"Policy of Truth\" did just fine as well, a low-key Motown funk number for the modern day with a sharp love/hate lyric to boot. To top it all off, the album itself scored on song after song, from the shuffling beat of \"Sweetest Perfection\" (well sung by Gore) and the ethereal \"Waiting for the Night\" to the guilt-ridden-and-loving-it \"Halo\" building into a string-swept pounder. \"Clean\" wraps up Violator on an eerie note, all ominous bass notes and odd atmospherics carrying the song. Goth without ever being stupidly hammy, synth without sounding like the clinical stereotype of synth music, rock without ever sounding like a \"rock\" band, Depeche here reach astounding heights indeed.

        "summary": "With their big, expansive sound and slightly rough edges, Brooklyn-via-Auckland band Streets of Laredo straddle the ever blurring lines between indie folk and pop. Much like Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros or Lord Huron, the seven-piece group relies on big, reverb-drenched group harmonies and a mix of modern indie pop and acoustic Americana. Led by Daniel, Dave, and Sarahjane Gibson, three siblings from New Zealand, the group relocated to Brooklyn, where they expanded their lineup and simmered for a time in the borough's fertile creative waters before heading back to Auckland to record the two debut EPs that they've packaged together here. These ten tales of love, adventure, and change document their journey to a new home and culture. Chock-full of acoustic guitars, steel guitar, harmonicas (diatonic and bass!), accordion, and plenty of stomping percussion, they've nailed the vogue sound of modern indie folk, but still have enough hooks and pop savvy to keep it interesting. ~ Timothy Monger",

Dominated by instrumentals, \"Shot in the Back of the Head\" is the most evocative of the bunch, seemingly pulled from an unreleased David Lynch film scored by the Afghan Whigs circa Gentlemen -- a lament from a dustbowl, full of mournful slide guitar and dewy electric piano. Other than \"Mistake\" -- a glum neo-post-punk rave-up that, despite its cathartic release, remains downcast -- Moby leaves the vocals to a series of women (neighborhood chums, apparently) who each contribute to one song. The smoky 3-a.m. gospel whispers from throwback soul singer Leela James on \"Walk with Me\" steal the show. ~ Andy Kellman",

        "summary": "The Wall was Roger Waters' crowning accomplishment in Pink Floyd. It documented the rise and fall of a rock star (named Pink Floyd), based on Waters' own experiences and the tendencies he'd observed in people around him. By then, the bassist had firm control of the group's direction, working mostly alongside David Gilmour and bringing in producer Bob Ezrin as an outside collaborator. Drummer Nick Mason was barely involved, while keyboardist Rick Wright seemed to be completely out of the picture. Still, The Wall was a mighty, sprawling affair, featuring 26 songs with vocals: nearly as many as all previous Floyd albums combined. The story revolves around the fictional Pink Floyd's isolation behind a psychological wall. The wall grows as various parts of his life spin out of control, and he grows incapable of dealing with his neuroses. The album opens by welcoming the unwitting listener to Floyd's show (\"In the Flesh?\"), then turns back to childhood memories of his father's death in World War II (\"Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 1\"), his mother's over protectiveness (\"Mother\"), and his fascination with and fear of sex (\"Young Lust\").  By the time \"Goodbye Cruel World\" closes the first disc, the wall is built and Pink is trapped in the midst of a mental breakdown. On disc two, the gentle acoustic phrasings of \"Is There Anybody Out There?\" and the lilting orchestrations of \"Nobody Home\" reinforce Floyd's feeling of isolation. When his record company uses drugs to coax him to perform (\"Comfortably Numb\"), his onstage persona is transformed into a homophobic, race-baiting fascist (\"In the Flesh\").  In \"The Trial,\" he mentally prosecutes himself, and the wall comes tumbling down. This ambitious concept album was an across-the-board smash, topping the Billboard album chart for 15 weeks in 1980.  The single \"Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2\" was the country's best-seller for four weeks. The Wall spawned an elaborate stage show (so elaborate, in fact, that the band was able to bring it to only a few cities) and a full-length film. It also marked the last time Waters and Gilmour would work together as equal partners. ~ Rovi Staff",

Though he cites influences like Woody Guthrie and Lead Belly, Ezra's music has more in common with the contemporary folk-pop of strummers like Vance Joy and Jake Bugg, with a bit of blue-eyed soul thrown in for good measure. Scrappy romps likes \"Cassy O'\" and his breakout track \"Budapest\" sit alongside quirky, synth-laden indie pop tunes like \"Stand by Your Gun\" and moody dirges like \"Spectacular Rival,\" offering up enough diversity to keep things interesting.

Blowing away the fuzzy, sonic indulgences of October with propulsive, martial rhythms and shards of guitar, War bristles with anger, despair, and above all, passion. Previously, Bono's attempts at messages came across as grandstanding, but his vision becomes remarkably clear on this record, as his anthems (\"New Year's Day,\" \"40,\" \"Seconds\") are balanced by effective, surprisingly emotional love songs (\"Two Hearts Beat as One\"), which are just as desperate and pleading as his protests. He performs the difficult task of making the universal sound personal, and the band helps him out by bringing the songs crashing home with muscular, forceful performances that reveal their varied, expressive textures upon repeated listens. U2 always aimed at greatness, but War was the first time they achieved it. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "War Child was Jethro Tull's first album after two chart-toppers, Thick as a Brick and A Passion Play, and was one of those records that was a hit the day it was announced (it was certified platinum based on pre-orders, the last Tull album to earn platinum record status). It never made the impression of its predecessors, however, as it was a return to standard-length songs following two epic-length pieces. It was inevitable that the material would lack power, if only because the opportunity for development that gave Thick as a Brick and A Passion Play some of their power. Additionally, the music was no longer quite able to cover for the obscurity of Tull's lyrics (\"Two Fingers\" being the best example). The title track is reasonably successful, but \"Queen and Country\" seems repetitive and pointless. \"Ladies,\" by contrast, is one of Tull's folk-based pieces, and one of the prettiest songs on the record, beautifully sung and benefiting from some of Anderson's best flute playing to date. The band is very tight but doesn't really get to show its stuff until \"Back-Door Angels,\" after which the album picks up. \"Sealion\" is one of Anderson's pseudo-philosophical musings on life, mixing full-out electric playing and restrained orchestral backing in a manner that recalls Thick as a Brick. \"Skating Away on the Thin Ice of a New Day\" is a beautiful, largely acoustic number that was popular in concert, but \"Bungle in the Jungle,\" with a title that went over well, got most of the radio play. \"The Third Hoorah\" is really a follow-up to \"War Child,\" and opens with one of the prettiest progressions on a folk tune in Tull's repertory, with some lovely harpsichord from John Evan evolving into a powerful rock number with a surprising orchestral break and what has to be the most successful appearance of bagpipes in a mainstream rock song.

        "summary": "The left-field success of Easy Beat meant that expectations were high for Dr. Dog's follow-up album, We All Belong. As a result, they probably could have brought in a big-name producer and booked time in a fancy studio. Fortunately, about the only thing that changed from one album to the other is a move from eight-track to 24-track recording. Yes, the songs are tightened up a bit and yes, some of the rougher edges have been smoothed out. They've also toned down the weirdness factor some (but not entirely). But these subtle changes do little to detract from the rough charm they've shown all along. It's clear that these guys think the feel of the take is more important than perfection, giving the album a loose feel throughout even though all the vocal harmonies and backing vox are spot-on (that's where all the extra tracks really pay off). And they're still their own best producer, too. All the backing vocals and harmonies are sparkling and meticulous, but the lead vocals and musical performances are the sound of real guys with real instruments playing together in the moment. Then there are the little details like the creeping reverb on the piano on \"My Old Ways,\" the grimy sound of \"The Girl,\" and the weird film-projector sound on \"Die, Die, Die.\" The guitars are raw but right, bass is bouncy and melodic, piano and organ are ubiquitous and percussion, strings and horns all make guest appearances. Then there are those wonderful backing vocals. Best of all, they've turned in another ultra-catchy set of tunes that somehow seem like you've heard them before. Though the bandmembers are still in their twenties, they deliver classic-sounding rock, taking elements from the Beatles, the Beach Boys, and the Band and mixing them up into something that sounds like Dr. Dog. We All Belong is a little bit cleaner and dressed a little bit nicer than Easy Beat, but the rustic appeal of the music still comes through loud and clear. ~ Sean Westergaard",

        "summary": "With their album-length 2012 EP Take the Kids Off Broadway, backwards-looking concept rockers Foxygen arrived with so many classic rock reference points you could have made a bingo card out of the various nods to various heroes contained in their still somehow undeniably hooky songs. Proper full-length We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace and Magic is even more stuffed full of familiar sound cues and convincing '60s and '70s pop star mimicry, this time with heightened production from Richard Swift taking the album out of the lo-fi realm, and more personal lyrics adding some character to the artifice. Picking apart the blatant, intentional references to different classic songs that cycle verse-to-verse throughout the album is a fun game for record collector types; from the nod to the intro of Sgt. Pepper's on album-opener \"In the Darkness\" to the bold-faced Dylanisms (and less overt but equally strong Al Stewart-isms) of the incredible, big city lament \"No Destruction.\" Bowie, Lou Reed, all eras of Mick Jagger, specific doo wop songs, and even moments of the Band; no oldies are safe from Foxygen's pure-hearted appropriation. Their reconstructive surgery of various influences is an interesting approach for a band made up of kids in their early twenties circa 2013, but it isn't the entire formula for what makes this record so great. Lots of bands before Foxygen have dealt with quick changes and sonic patchworks of older influences, but few have managed to craft songs as moving and catchy as these. The thick accents and psychedelic swirl of \"San Francisco\" walk the line of being patronizingly nostalgic until the hook-heavy chorus comes in, distant guest vocals from Jessie Baylin and Sarah Versprille answering singer Sam France's \"I left my love in San Francisco\" with refrains of \"That's okay, I was bored anyway\" and \"That's okay, I was born in L.A.\" This one move disarms any cloying elements of the song and reminds the listener that Foxygen are in complete songwriting control, not just throwing back-dated pop culture references at the wall and hoping something sticks. In their earliest days, Of Montreal had a similar knack for updating their favorite records with their own personalities, as did many artists of the Elephant 6 collective, but WAT21CAOPAM is more tuned in, clear-headed, and full of intent than any of Foxygen's more immediate predecessors. It's a gorgeous and non-stop convergence of ideas, some borrowed, some original, some refurbished, and some outright stolen. In the end, however, the album's coherence comes in its incredible architecture of all these ideas, and the way the band sells them with everything they've got, taking what could be incredibly obtuse music back into the realm of pop from which it was born.

        "summary": "The debut full-length album from producer/songwriter Emile Haynie, 2015's We Fall, is a lush, star-studded affair that puts a spotlight on Haynie's grand, cinematic pop aesthetic. Having begun his career working primarily with hip-hop artists like Eminem, Ghostface Killah, and Kid Cudi, Haynie eventually expanded his reach, helming productions for such top-tier pop names as P!nk, OneRepublic, Bruno Mars, and others. With his varied musical background, Haynie has a crate digger's taste for vintage vinyl sounds, as well as a DJ's skill for recontextualizing those sounds with contemporary pop sensibilities. Consequently, Haynie is as comfortable working on a beat-heavy dance remix as he is constructing a lush, orchestral performance. With We Fall, Haynie puts all of his eclectic skills and stylistic tastes together, showcasing his studio prowess and compositional talent, as well as his knack for bringing disparate talents together to create new and serendipitously effective songs. And while one might worry at Haynie's ability to fully integrate all of these divergent elements, in the end, We Fall has a surprisingly homogenous sound steeped in a Baroque, psychedelic '60s pop and soul. In that sense, Haynie brings to mind the work of his similarly inclined contemporary Mark Ronson, whose own cameo-packed albums could easily have been inspirational antecedents for Haynie. Haynie even brings on board longtime Ronson associate Fires of Rome vocalist Andrew Wyatt, who holds his own against two legends of '60s pop with the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson on \"Falling Apart,\" and the Zombies' Colin Blunstone on \"Nobody Believes You.\" Elsewhere, there's a handful of similarly engaging cuts such as the yearning \"Wait for Life\" with Lana Del Rey, the languid \"Little Ballerina\" with Rufus Wainwright, and the catchy \"Who to Blame\" featuring Randy Newman. ~ Matt Collar",

        "summary": "Sometimes rowdy, frequently playful, and brimming with spark, the debut album by Canadian pop singer 12 tracks. From suggestive, digital sludge-pop romps like \"Cloud 69\" to good-natured, socially minded affirmations like the catchy cheer leading of \"LGBT,\" We Loved Her Dearly puts the young Torontonian's variety on full display. Brought to life by a committee of producers that includes Swedish veteran Martin Terefe (Ron Sexsmith, Train, KT Tunstall) and British songwriter Paul Herman (Corinne Bailey Rae, Emeli Sande), along with several others, the album contains a host of great ideas and sounds, but with all those cooks in the kitchen, it can sometimes feel a bit unfocused. Much of the music rambles along in a state of distorted experimentalism with a mix of synths and compressed rhythms reminiscent of early MGMT, while Lowell's unique voice casually dips and dives through a variety of impressive ranges. Her more minimalist summer pop efforts on \"Summertime\" and \"Palm Trees\" are lovely and engaging, while the laid-back, midtempo charmer \"The Bells\" coasts along with a distant warmth and a group chorus of \"where'd the beat go\" that sounds dangerously close to Sparks' similar group chant from their 2002 cut \"The Rhythm Thief.\" Meanwhile, Lowell's themes of affirmation and feminism are quite refreshing on inspiring cuts like \"Words Were the Wars\" and \"I Love You Money.\" We Loved Her Dearly shows a lot of promise and there's plenty to like about Lowell's attitude and talent, but some gentle tightening of her vision would go a long way in strengthening her image.

Bolstered by a handful of engaging singles like âGenerator ^ First Floor,â âLocationâ and âWe Could Be Friendsâ, itâs hard to find fault with the album's intricate arrangements and top notch production, but the songs, which rarely change key, begin to congeal into one big independent film trailer montage as the record progresses. Lead singer Judah Dadoneâs clear, even tenor dutifully leads the charge, and the groupâs penchant for folksy instrumentation mixed with meticulous electro flourishes and familiar, sing-songy melodies (occasionally repeated Ad nauseam) is well executed, but the ten songs and three instrumental interludes that make up Weathervanes' 45-minute runtime feel more like they were generated by a sentient computer with a top-notch, five boroughs-centric, indie pop digital collection than actual human beings. ~ James Christopher Monger",

        "summary": "Utterly lacking in rock star pretense, Britain's Happyness are a roil of contradictions on their pretty great 2015 full-length debut, Weird Little Birthday, a fact that only makes them all the more intriguing. Essentially a lo-fi T-shirt and baggy jeans band, Happyness make a shambling, heartbreaking, often wryly humorous style of late-'80s/early-'90s indie rock. Comprising the very engineering-student-looking trio of singer/guitarist Benji Compston, singer/bassist Jonny Allan, and drummer Ash Cooper, Happyness drew favorable early comparisons to bands like Weezer and Pavement, and certainly, Allan's half-lidded, laconic delivery and cryptic Dada diary lyrics do bring to mind Pavement's Stephen Malkmus. That said, cuts like the shambolically melodic \"Great Minds Think Alike, All Brains Taste the Same\" and the sludgy shimmer of \"Orange Luz\" also bring to mind early Teenage Fanclub. Similarly, \"Naked Patients,\" with its chug-a-long rhythm and sweet-toned backing vocals from Saffron Le Bon, splits the difference between Galaxie 500 and Sebadoh. It also doesn't hurt that Happyness write seemingly straightforward, often deftly simplistic tunes that are also, upon closer inspection, disarmingly intimate, literate, and musically intricate. One minute they're blowing out your speakers, ripping through a punk rock jam in under two minutes (\"Refrigerate Her\"), only to follow that up with an extended, jazz-inflected bedroom pop ballad (\"Weird Little Birthday Girl\"), ripe with emotive, poetic lyrics that strike a perfect balance between melancholic introspection and goofy surrealism. On the softly buoyant title track, Allan sings \"And every day is like your birthday, with all the get-ups and the weird smiling/Day you couldn't get your head in the dog door/Couldn't get my brain in your belly.\" They also have a knack for capturing the aching awkwardness of growing up and the overwhelming envy and chaotic joy that it brings. On \"It's on You,\" Allan sings \"Remember when we broke into the park and you got laid and I watched/And you said that was fine/You said you didn't like government, or school, you're so cool/You're just like Robin Hood.\" Ultimately, the influences are there, but if aping style was where it ended with Happyness, there wouldn't be so much to enjoy and dig deeper into about Weird Little Birthday. ~ Matt Collar",

        "parentTitle": "The Cave Singers",
        "summary": "With a warmer style than the name Cave Singers might suggest, Welcome Joy is a simple and easygoing indie folk romp that picks up right where the trio's debut, Invitation Songs, left off. Welcome Joy was recorded again with Black Mountain's Colin Stewart in Vancouver, and his pals Amber Webber (of Black Mountain and Lightning Dust) and Ashley Webber (also of Lightning Dust) assisted Derek Fudesco, Marty Lund, and Pete Quirk on the record. It's an Americana-rooted soundtrack for the change of the seasons, with two-chord structures and organic, free-spirited instrumentation. John Prine and Jeff Tweedy are touchstones here, but the most overt influence is Fleetwood Mac. Not only do the songs resemble the melodies found on Rumours, but coincidentally, Quirk's voice sounds a lot like a cross between Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. \"I Don't Mind\" is a carefree jamboree, with kick drum, tambourine, and harmonica laying the foundation for a fingerpicked electric guitar. Meanwhile, \"VV\" is a pleasant backwoods birdwatching ditty, and \"Leap\" propels from a stripped-down guitar and vocal line into a full-fledged rollicking romp. A few songs take a tougher turn -- \"At the Cut\" incorporates some gritty distortion and \"Shrine\" is a dark, brooding bongo number, where Quirk's weathered voice shines, but the Cave Singers' best moments are when they tone back the brooding and stick to carefree major-chord jams. Most of the album stays true to a light flavor, and Welcome Joy is a nice, comfortable listen, right up there with Invitation Songs. ~ Jason Lymangrover",

        "summary": "The Decemberists belatedly embraced their indie pop sensibilities (or at very least their fondness for R.E.M.) on 2011's The King Is Dead, and were rewarded with a number one chart placing and the group's greatest commercial success to date, leading some to wonder if Colin Meloy and his bandmates were going to go for more hooks or return to the more ornate sound of their earlier work now that they had a large audience waiting for the follow-up. As it turns out, 2014's What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World finds the Decemberists managing to have it both ways; if anything, many of these songs are brighter and hookier than those on The King Is Dead, but if this is pop, it's pop that's keenly intelligent, melodically adventurous, obsessively literate, and perfectly willing to explore sadness and disappointment rather than just the upbeat moods that are expected to accompany catchy melodies. The melodies on \"Lake Song\" and \"Till the Water Is All Long Gone\" may be more streamlined than you'd hear on Picaresque or The Crane Wife, but the arrangements are richly detailed, playing on the dynamics of Chris Funk's guitars, Jenny Conlee's keyboards and accordions, and John Moen's percussion, and the group takes much pleasure in the dour beauty of its melodies. The band also embraces its upbeat side on this album with numbers like \"The Wrong Year\" and \"Philomena\" (the latter pondering teenage lust as only the Decemberists can), and the opening track, \"The Singer Addresses His Audience,\" is a witty but cutting meditation on the notion of fame, its impact on the culture, and where the Decemberists fit into the puzzle in the wake of hit records and appearances on Parks & Recreation. There's still more than enough folk in the Decemberists' approach to make them stand apart from their peers on the upper reaches of the pop charts, and the intuitive smarts of their stylistic vision are still front and center, but What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World is an album where the creative sprawl is more a matter of how this divergent selection of melodies and moods interacts, rather than how many elements can be folded into one song; this is very clearly the Decemberists, but with a new kind of focus in their songs and arrangements that makes it clear this album's sound is a result of creative evolution, not an offering to their newer, larger audience, and it's a sweet and sour wonder that rewards repeated listening. ~ Mark Deming",

They sound more like a band now; along with Alpert's now-indelibly stamped trumpet sound, we can recognize jazzman John Pisano's distinctive rhythm guitar, Lou Pagani's piano, the droll Bob Edmondson's dulcet trombone, etc. Pisano, who debuted as a composer on Going Places, comes up with a memorably whistleable song \"So What's New,\" and the rest of Alpert's songwriting brigade (Ervan Coleman, Julius Wechter and Sol Lake) chime in with some lively, catchy tunes. There is also an assortment of pop, film, and Broadway standards of the day, all impeccably arranged by Alpert, whose production instincts grew sharper and surer with every release. Result: another hugely entertaining hit LP, one that stayed at number one longer than any other TJB album (nine weeks). ~ Richard S. Ginell",

        "summary": "If Definitely Maybe was an unintentional concept album about wanting to be a rock & roll star, (What's the Story) Morning Glory? is what happens after the dreams come true. Oasis turns in a relatively introspective second record, filled with big, gorgeous ballads instead of ripping rockers. Unlike Definitely Maybe, the production on Morning Glory is varied enough to handle the range in emotions; instead of drowning everything with amplifiers turned up to 12, there are strings, keyboards, and harmonicas. This expanded production helps give Noel Gallagher's sweeping melodies an emotional resonance that he occasionally can't convey lyrically. However, that is far from a fatal flaw; Gallagher's lyrics work best in fragments, where the images catch in your mind and grow, thanks to the music. Gallagher may be guilty of some borrowing, or even plagiarism, but he uses the familiar riffs as building blocks. This is where his genius lies: He's a thief and doesn't have many original thoughts, but as a pop/rock melodicist he's pretty much without peer. Likewise, as musicians, Oasis are hardly innovators, yet they have a majestic grandeur in their sound that makes ballads like \"Wonderwall\" or rockers like \"Some Might Say\" positively transcendent. Alan White does add authority to the rhythm section, but the most noticeable change is in Liam Gallagher. His voice sneered throughout Definitely Maybe, but on Morning Glory his singing has become more textured and skillful. He gives the lyric in the raging title track a hint of regret, is sympathetic on \"Wonderwall,\" defiant on \"Some Might Say,\" and humorous on \"She's Electric,\" a bawdy rewrite of \"Digsy's Diner.\" It might not have the immediate impact of Definitely Maybe, but Morning Glory is just as exciting and compulsively listenable.

        "summary": "If Disraeli Gears was the album where Cream came into their own, its successor, Wheels of Fire, finds the trio in full fight, capturing every side of their multi-faceted personality, even hinting at the internal pressures that soon would tear the band asunder. A dense, unwieldy double album split into an LP of new studio material and an LP of live material, it's sprawling and scattered, at once awesome in its achievement and maddening in how it falls just short of greatness. It misses its goal not because one LP works and the other doesn't, but because both the live and studio sets suffer from strikingly similar flaws, deriving from the constant power struggle between the trio. Of the three, Ginger Baker comes up short, contributing the passable \"Passing the Time\" and \"Those Were the Days,\" which are overshadowed by how he extends his solo drum showcase \"Toad\" to a numbing quarter of an hour and trips upon the Wind & the Willows whimsy of \"Pressed Rat and Warthog,\" whose studied eccentricity pales next to Eric Clapton's nimble, eerily cheerful \"Anyone for Tennis.\" In almost every regard, Wheels of Fire is a terrific showcase for Clapton as a guitarist, especially on the first side of the live album with \"Crossroads,\" a mighty encapsulation of all of his strengths. Some of that is studio trickery, as producer Felix Pappalardi cut together the best bits of a winding improvisation to a tight four minutes, giving this track a relentless momentum that's exceptionally exciting, but there's no denying that Clapton is at a peak here, whether he's tearing off solos on a 17-minute \"Spoonful\" or goosing \"White Room\" toward the heights of madness. But it's the architect of \"White Room,\" bassist Jack Bruce, who, along with his collaborator Peter Brown, reaches a peak as a songwriter. Aside from the monumental \"White Room,\" he has the lovely, wistful \"As You Said,\" the cinematic \"Deserted Cities of the Heart,\" and the slow, cynical blues \"Politician,\" all among Cream's very best work. And in many ways Wheels of Fire is indeed filled with Cream's very best work, since it also captures the fury and invention (and indulgence) of the band at its peak on the stage and in the studio, but as it tries to find a delicate balance between these three titanic egos, it doesn't quite add up to something greater than the sum of its parts. But taken alone, those individual parts are often quite tremendous. [Wheels of Fire was re-released on LP in 2015.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "Building upon the Long Winters' first album, The Worst You Can Do Is Harm, frontman John Roderick compiled enough hooks to create the solid, delectably pop sophomore effort When I Pretend to Fall. The Long Winters get happy on this one, and Roderick's vibrant, newfound confidence as a showman and songwriter allows the Long Winters' sound to finally gel. Chris Walla, Sean Nelson, Eric Corson, and Michael Schilling return for some sonic goodness, while ex-Posies guitarist/vocalist Ken Stringfellow joins the Long Winters to polish things up a bit. Extra help from R.E.M.'s Peter Buck and Pedro the Lion's Blake Wescott is a bonus in adding to Roderick's nearly accessible candied rock sound. Album opener \"Blue Diamonds\" kicks things off with a swanky brass section. Roderick's self-assured vocals are a touch shy at first, but the Michael Stipe comparisons immediately disappear mid-chorus. Roderick takes control and he likes it; it sounds so good on the synth-driven '60s pop of \"Scared Straight.\" Shimmering space rock guitars and budding string arrangements carry the melodies of \"Blanket Hog\" for one of the album's brightest moments, while \"Prom Night at Hater High\" is equally energetic with its hoedown-like appeal. When it seems like the Long Winters could use a break or at least a breather, \"New Girl\" gets cheeky with classic power pop. When I Pretend to Fall aptly suggests that things could go one way, but Roderick and company push and pull with harmony and emotion for a full, tangible set of songs. One listen to \"Nora\" and you'll sense Roderick's soft heart. It charms you; a soft heart doesn't equal a simple album, however. ~ MacKenzie Wilson",

        "summary": "When A.A. Bondy was lead singer for Verbena, the band was often accused of lifting large portions of its sound and style from the Rolling Stones (on its first album) and Nirvana (on Into the Pink). So with that history, it makes a certain sense that Bondy's second solo effort, When the Devil's Loose, recalls another artist, in this case Ryan Adams. The largest part of this comes from Bondy's voice, which bears a reasonable aural resemblance to Adams and his sweetly jaded tone, though Bondy shows off a bit more sonic weight and a less studied demeanor. But the music isn't all that far away from Adams either, though if this is by design rather than accident, at least Bondy has the good sense to embrace the straightforward and emotionally powerful sound of Heartbreaker rather than the more scattershot style of Adams' subsequent solo efforts. Most of When the Devil's Loose was cut with just a bassist (Macey Taylor) and drummer (Paul Buchignani) accompanying Bondy and his guitar, and the sessions have an air of gentle melancholy that brings out their graceful balance of blues and country accents; the minimal backing emphasizes the late-night vibe of the music, and the deep lonesome wanderings of the melodies are an ideal match for the downbeat storytelling of \"On the Moon,\" \"Oh the Vampyre,\" and \"The Coal Hits the Fire.\" Bruce Watson's production is subtle and nonintrusive, and that works beautifully in favor of the songs, which clearly play best without excess gingerbread and with Bondy's voice and lyrics placed front and center. When the Devil's Loose might share some reference points with another singer/songwriter with a similar offhand affection for roots music, but A.A. Bondy seems to be developing a voice of his own despite all the surface similarities, and the result is a quietly powerful album of songs that cut deeper into the heart and soul than you might expect at first glance. ~ Mark Deming",

The album's only flaw is its tendency to slip into almost emo-ish constructions (standard Braid and Boys Life moves) -- thankfully, though, this leaning is rare in comparison to the charming pop that makes When You Land Here so lovable. Though Flake Music needed a bit more focus and invention, their work here holds the potential that James Mercer and company more than delivered on just a few years later with the classic Oh, Inverted World. ~ Nitsuh Abebe",

The bandleader/trumpeter was joined by Tonni Kalash (trumpet), Robert Edmondson (trombone), Pat Senatore (bass), John Pisano (guitars), Lou Pagani (piano), and Nick Ceroli (drums).

Not bad, considering the market was being heavily infiltrated, if not practically dominated by the British Invasion.

Sol Lake -- who provided Alpert \"The Lonely Bull\" and \"Mexican Shuffle\" returns, and this time he has custom-made the upbeat and, above all, catchy trio of \"Green Peppers,\" \"Bittersweet Samba,\" and \"El Garbanzo.\" Allen Toussaint's title composition \"Whipped Cream\" garnered significant attention, but not as a chart hit. Rather, it could be heard as bachelorettes were being introduced on ABC-TV's The Dating Game. Early in the series run, additional Alpert offerings were also incorporated as incidental music: \"Spanish Flea,\" as the bachelors were being announced, \"Lollipops and Roses,\" when the lucky winners were being told where they would be spending their date, and both \"Ladyfingers\" and \"Lemon Tree\" were in rotation as contestants mulled over their answers.

        "summary": "Simply put, this box includes eight studio albums by War, the stellar Southern California unit that had been together in one form or another -- and with different names and personnel -- since 1962, though they didn't begin recording until 1970 as Eric Burdon's backing band. While Burdon moved on, predictably, the unit, enhanced by the Danish born harmonica player Lee Oskar, embarked on a string of recordings beginning with their self-titled album in 1971, followed by a most impressive run throughout most of the '70s, when the band dropped only the self-titled offering, but also revealed the genius that became All Day Music, The World Is a Ghetto, Deliver the Word, Why Can't We Be Friends?, and Platinum Jazz. Along with Mandrill, War ushered in a near perfect meld of funk, jazz, Latin rhythms, soul, gospel, and rock, played with virtuosity and requisite passion. \r\nThis Rhino set -- first released in 1994 -- collects the aforementioned albums plus 1982's big-selling Outlaw that featured the title track and \"Cinco de Mayo,\" and 1994's reunion album Peace Sign, that included the singles \"I'm the One (Who Understands),\" and \"East L.A.,\" in addition to the title cut. Rhino has remastered all of the original albums, though there is no extra material on any of the discs; however, they don't need any. As self-contained albums go, most of these were perfect. While the live album is also missing here, it is basically superfluous and should be heard on its own. The box is handsome, yet is has no liner notes and all of these albums are available individually, so it's difficult to know who this set will appeal to -- better a box set of LPs should have been issued. The music, however, remains the focus and for that reason alone this can't be beat. ~ Thom Jurek",

        "summary": "After 35 years into a career that spans 35 albums recorded for seven labels, you'd think John Hammond might get a little complacent. Thankfully the opposite is true, as 2001's Wicked Grin is the artist's most daring musical departure and arguably greatest achievement to date. Mining the rich Tom Waits catalog for 12 of its 13 tracks (the closing is a traditional gospel tune) and bringing Waits himself along as producer has resulted in a stunning collection that stands as one of the best in Hammond's bulging catalog. Never a songwriter, the singer/guitarist/harmonica bluesman has maintained a knack for picking top-notch material from the rich blues tradition without resorting to the hoary, over-covered classics of the genre. It's that quality that transforms these tunes into Hammond songs, regardless of their origin. His history of working with exceptional session musicians is also legendary, and this album's band, which features Doug Sahm sideman Augie Meyers on keyboards, harmonica wiz Charlie Musselwhite, longtime Waits associate Larry Taylor on bass, and Waits himself poking around on various songs, is perfect for the spooky, swampy feel he effortlessly conjures here. Choosing from a wide variety of Waits' material, Hammond infuses these unusual tracks with a bluesman's spirit and a crackling energy that practically reinvents the songs, instilling them with an ominous, rhythmic swampy feel. The producer contributes two new tracks (\"2:19\" and \"Fannin' Street,\" the latter is the album's only acoustic cut) that maintain the creepy but upbeat voodoo spirit that trickles and twists throughout. Hammond sings with a renewed spirit, adding a smoother but no less intense edge than Waits' typical rusty razor blade soaked whisky growl. With his dusky croon and idiosyncratic delivery, Hammond tears into this material with relish, spitting out the often offbeat, stream of consciousness lyrics as if he wrote them himself. Only the slow, ambling blues of \"Murder in the Red Barn\" would comfortably slot into Hammond's existing oeuvre; the remainder push the bluesman into previously uncharted territory with results that reveal fascinating layers of his own interpretive abilities. An experiment whose success will hopefully yield another volume, this partnership of John Hammond and Tom Waits brings out the best in both artists' substantial talents. ~ Hal Horowitz",

        "summary": "The title is quintessentially Stephen Malkmus -- a conflation of two slang terms, one dating back to the hazed-out '60s, the other a vulgar remnant of modernity -- and, as it happens, Wig Out at Jagbags also sounds quintessentially Malkmusian. It's elastic guitar rock constructed partially out of cannabis guitar jams and partially out of punk rock squalls, both sides distinguished by wry melodicism and dexterous wordplay, not to mention Malkmus' lingering tendency to hide his accessible inclinations under sheets of six-strings. On 2011's Mirror Traffic, producer Beck prevented the Jicks from taking detours, but here the band is producing on its own, assisted by Remko Schouten, so they're free to follow wherever their whims may take them. In the past, the untrammeled Jicks usually pursued one of their twin obsessions -- either riding out a cool, non-funky groove or opening up the skies with guitars, ideally blending the two -- but here, there's a distinct mellowing as the forays into psychedelia and noise skronk are tempered as Malkmus once again finds fascination in colorful, swaying pop. Often, this takes the form of updated latter-day Pavement -- the sing-song \"Lariat\" and \"Cinnamon and Lesbians\" find their roots in Brighten the Corners -- but no matter if Malkmus is singing about \"music from the Best Decade Ever,\" there's no sense of nostalgia here, no suspicion that he'd rather be playing with a reunited Pavement than the Jicks, perhaps because Wig Out at Jagbags -- the first album he's recorded since reuniting with his '90s band in 2010; it's the also the first without Janet Weiss, who left in 2010 to play with Wild Flag and has been replaced by Jake Morris -- is nimble in a way Malkmus has rarely been. As the Jicks trim their improvisations, they retain a mischievous spirit -- witness the cheery horn stabs of \"Chartjunk,\" which swaggers like prime crossover Spoon and thereby raises the question of whether the song is a piss-take -- which means that even if Wig Out at Jagbags is quieter than, say, 2008's churning Real Emotional Trash, it feels looser than most of the Jicks records; the compositions are tight but the attitude is ragged, which winds up being more infectious and fun than albums where the songs drift but the instruments are tight. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "parentTitle": "The Tallest Man on Earth",
        "summary": "In nearly every respect, Swedish troubadour Kristian Matsson's second full-length outing as the Tallest Man on Earth is a direct continuation of the stripped-down roots folk style he introduced on his debut -- an album that was deeply, unambiguously steeped in rural American folk tradition but also the product of a strong singular vision and voice. Arguably the most significant difference this time out is the wider stateside distribution that The Wild Hunt will enjoy thanks to its presence on Dead Oceans, and, hopefully, an attendant increase in exposure. It's richly deserved: even if -- as may initially seem to be the case -- this album offered nothing more than another ten songs cut from Shallow Grave's rough-hewn yet rarefied cloth, it would be considerable cause for celebration; for an ostensible one trick pony, Matsson's got a hell of a trick. But he's more than that: his distinctive gifts as a songwriter are more than equal to his undeniable flair as a musical stylist, and if the uncanny anachronistic effect of his work isn't quite as revelatory the second time around, this set offers the subtler treat of hearing an artist carve out further space for personal nuance and expression within an already well-established approach. Careful listening reveals a newfound looseness and emotional range here, particularly in the vocals, with tender moments like the sweetly sung \"Love Is All\" and bittersweet relationship dissection \"The Drying of the Lawns\" balancing the typically visceral, nearly strident delivery of songs like \"You're Going Back\" and jaunty highlight \"King of Spain\" (which wryly tips a hat to Matsson's most undeniable forerunner with its reference to \"boots of Spanish leather\"). Lyrically, too, his writing has grown somewhat more lucid and expressive, with even his characteristically poetic evocations of the natural world connecting on a more human and relatable level than past abstractions (from \"Burden of Tomorrow\": \"I'm just a blind man on the plains/I drink my water when it rains/And live by chance among the lightning strikes\"). Still, The Wild Hunt could hardly be called a reinvention. Save for the unexpectedly Springsteen-esque closer, \"Kids on the Run,\" wherein Matsson trades in his trusty six-string for a piano, anything here could have slotted neatly onto Shallow Grave. And that's no trouble at all: when you sound like virtually nobody else out there, it's hard to complain about more of the same. ~ K. Ross Hoffman",

        "summary": "Who could blame Mumford & Sons for running away from their signature banjo stomp? Come 2015, when Wilder Mind saw spring release, so many bands had copped their big-footed folk jamboree that Mumford & Sons could feel the straitjacket constricting, so it's not a surprise that the group decided to try on something new. A change in fashion isn't strange -- no band wants to be pigeonholed -- but the odd thing about Wilder Mind is now that everybody else sounds like Mumford & Sons, Mumford & Sons decide to sound like everybody else. Without their old-timey affectations, the band seems interchangeable with any number of blandly attractive AAA rockers, a group that favors sound over song -- a curious switch for a purportedly old-fashioned quartet. Sometimes, the band do swing for arena-filling hooks and connect -- the quietly escalating \"Believe,\" the incessant surge of \"The Wolf,\" \"Ditmas,\" which is the only song here that would scale to bare-bones acoustic arrangements -- but usually they subsist on a simmer, letting their immaculate, tasteful rock bubble quietly without ever threatening to spill over the edge. Often, the persistent, moody murmur recalls a diluted Kings of Leon, a comparison that can't help but underscore how Mumford & Sons have made the journey from retro throwback to glistening modern construction. Where once they carved their music out of reclaimed wood, they're now all steel and glass -- a bit sleeker but also a bit chillier. Such a description suggests this is a big shift, but it's all surface: underneath that exterior, Wilder Mind is the same Mumford & Sons, peddling reasonably handsome reconstructions of times gone by.

        "summary": "Make no mistake, Willy & the Poor Boys is a fun record, perhaps the breeziest album CCR ever made. Apart from the eerie minor-key closer \"Effigy\" (one of John Fogerty's most haunting numbers), there is little of the doom that colored Green River. Fogerty's rage remains, blazing to the forefront on \"Fortunate Son,\" a working-class protest song that cuts harder than any of the explicit Vietnam protest songs of the era, which is one of the reasons that it hasn't aged where its peers have. Also, there's that unbridled vocal from Fogerty and the ferocious playing on CCR, which both sound fresh as they did upon release. \"Fortunate Son\" is one of the greatest, hardest rock & rollers ever cut, so it might seem to be out of step with an album that is pretty laid-back and friendly, but there's that elemental joy that by late '69 was one of CCR's main trademarks. That joy runs throughout the album, from the gleeful single \"Down on the Corner\" and the lazy jugband blues of \"Poorboy Shuffle\" through the great slow blues jam \"Feelin' Blue\" to the great rockabilly spiritual \"Don't Look Now,\" one of Fogerty's overlooked gems. The covers don't feel like throwaways, either, since both \"Cotton Fields\" and \"The Midnight Special\" have been overhauled to feel like genuine CCR songs. It all adds up to one of the greatest pure rock & roll records ever cut. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "With the Beatles is a sequel of the highest order -- one that betters the original by developing its own tone and adding depth. While it may share several similarities with its predecessor -- there is an equal ratio of covers-to-originals, a familiar blend of girl group, Motown, R&B, pop, and rock, and a show tune that interrupts the flow of the album -- With the Beatles is a better record that not only rocks harder, it's considerably more sophisticated. They could deliver rock & roll straight (\"I Wanna Be Your Man\") or twist it around with a little Latin lilt (\"Little Child,\" one of their most underrated early rockers); Lennon and McCartney wrote sweet ballads (the achingly gorgeous \"All I've Got to Do\") and sprightly pop/rockers (\"All My Loving\") with equal aplomb; and the propulsive rockers (\"It Won't Be Long\") were as richly melodic as slower songs (\"Not a Second Time\"). Even George Harrison's first recorded song, \"Don't Bother Me,\" is a standout, with its wonderfully foreboding minor-key melody. Since the Beatles covered so much ground with their originals, their covers pale slightly in comparison, particularly since they rely on familiar hits (only \"Devil in Her Heart\" qualifies as a forgotten gem). But for every \"Roll Over Beethoven,\" a surprisingly stiff reading of the Chuck Berry standard, there is a sublime moment, such as Lennon's soaring interpretation of \"You Really Got a Hold on Me,\" and the group always turns in thoroughly enjoyable performances. Still, the heart of With the Beatles lies not in the covers, but the originals, where it was clear that, even at this early stage, the Beatles were rapidly maturing and changing, turning into expert craftsmen and musical innovators. [With the Beatles was re-released in mono on vinyl in 2014.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

This set is part compilation, collecting recent singles and movie soundtrack pieces, part new covers of hit songs done in the group's unique style, and part new compositions from the group. One of the clear highlights is the homage to the various Batman themes over the years, \"Batman Evolution.\" ~ Steve Leggett",

Highlights include \"Man Like You,\" \"Machinery of the Heavens\" and \"Tracy's Water.\" ~ Charity Stafford",

        "summary": "There is no other album like Bat Out of Hell, unless you want to count the sequel. This is Grand Guignol pop -- epic, gothic, operatic, and silly, and it's appealing because of all of this. Jim Steinman was a composer without peer, simply because nobody else wanted to make mini-epics like this. And there never could have been a singer more suited for his compositions than Meat Loaf, a singer partial to bombast, albeit shaded bombast. The compositions are staggeringly ridiculous, yet Meat Loaf finds the emotional core in each song, bringing true heartbreak to \"Two out of Three Ain't Bad\" and sly humor to \"Paradise by the Dashboard Light.\" There's no discounting the production of Todd Rundgren, either, who gives Steinman's self-styled grandiosity a production that's staggeringly big but never overwhelming and always alluring. While the sentiments are deliberately adolescent and filled with jokes and exaggerated clichÃ©s, there's real (albeit silly) wit behind these compositions, not just in the lyrics but in the music, which is a savvy blend of oldies pastiche, show tunes, prog rock, Springsteen-esque narratives, and blistering hard rock (thereby sounding a bit like an extension of Rocky Horror Picture Show, which brought Meat Loaf to the national stage). It may be easy to dismiss this as ridiculous, but there's real style and craft here and its kitsch is intentional. It may elevate adolescent passion to operatic dimensions, and that's certainly silly, but it's hard not to marvel at the skill behind this grandly silly, irresistible album. [A Super Audio Hybrid CD version of Bat Out of Hell was released in 2015.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "It's no secret that the Leeds-based Kaiser Chiefs love the Jam. The band's 2005 excellent but uneven debut Employment was an infectious salute to all things mod and Brit-pop, boasting three solid singles (\"I Predict a Riot,\" \"Oh My God\" and \"Everyday I Love You Less and Less\") that held great promise for future endeavors. On Yours Truly, Angry Mob, the group takes a little more time in establishing its pop acumen, offering no immediate pay-offs despite its insatiable thirst for FM melody. Opener and first single \"Ruby,\" a rowdy, mid-tempo singalong that gets everything right but feels a little tossed-off and disposable, is indicative of Angry Mob's first half -- \"Heat Dies Down,\" \"Love's Not a Competition (But I'm Winning)\" and \"Highroyds\" have all of their cogs well-oiled and reliably dressed, but there's nothing here that warrants the inevitable second listen in which a perfectly constructed pop song's true genius is revealed. To that end, Angry Mob is creatively back loaded (though not genius), relying on a series of rewarding and occasionally subversive tracks like \"I Can Do It Without You,\" \"Learnt My Lesson Well,\" \"My Kind of Guy\" and closer \"Retirement\" to avoid the dreaded sophomore slump, revealing a band that is likely to continue pumping out albums with a few great songs on them until the requisite \"Greatest Hits\" collection arrives.

        "summary": "The artificial synth-horn tones and repurposed Prince beat that begin \"Shapeless,\" the first song on Nashville-via-Brooklyn band Wild Cub's debut album Youth, would seem to set the tone for an album of updated '80s synth pop viewed through an indie lens. This is at least partially true, as there's an '80s reference point on almost each of this lengthy album's 15 tracks. Principle singer/songwriter Keegan DeWitt's vocals draw on Peter Gabriel, Bowie, and even some Achtung Baby-era Bono-isms on the swimmy downer ballad \"Drive.\" New Order-seeped guitar melodies, John Hughes soundtrack nostalgia, and bouncy retro-electro rhythms also funnel into the heavy '80s influence, but apart from these familiar elements, DeWitt and his multi-instrumentalist partner Jeremy Bullock manage to take each track into unexpected places without losing the overall thread. Individually, every song seems to be exploring a wildly different territory than the others, evidenced in the disparity between the cheesy guitar noodling and Phil Collins reimagining of \"Hidden in the Night\" and the bounding, feel-good clarity of songs like \"Windows,\" \"Wild Light,\" or the shamelessly romantic and endlessly catchy \"Thunder Clap.\" Similarly \"Straight No Turns\" is built around a dancy beat so hypnotic it almost becomes a club track on its extended fade-out, but blurs into almost ambient dreaminess a few songs later on the decidedly more organic tune \"The Water.\" While each song seems to be trying on dramatically different ideas and styles, they all gel when taken as a whole. DeWitt's melodies seem to cycle and repeat throughout the album, giving cohesion to the songs as they amble between direct pop hooks and aimless experimenting. Themes of burning, youthful love and its uncontrollable urgency come through louder than any production choice on Youth. Similar to the cloudy nostalgia of M83 or the melodramatic yet heartfelt howling of the Arcade Fire at their most sincere, Wild Cub taps into a specific emotional thread and rides it throughout every single song here. While certain songs definitely stand on their own, the ability to capture a feeling throughout is what makes the album memorable and worthy of repeat listening. ~ Fred Thomas",

        "summary": "Fatboy Slim's debut album, Better Living Through Chemistry, was one of the surprises of the big-beat revolution of 1996: an eclectic blowout all tracked to thunderous loops and masterminded by Norman Cook, a former member of the British pop band the Housemartins. It might not have been as startlingly fresh as the Chemical Brothers, but the hard-hitting beats and catchiness, not to mention consistency, of Better Living was a shock, and it raised expectations for Fatboy Slim's second album, You've Come a Long Way, Baby. And that record itself was something of a surprise, since it not only exceeded the expectations set by the debut, but came damn close to being the definitive big-beat album, rivaling the Chemicals' second record, Dig Your Own Hole. The difference is, Cook is a record geek with extensive knowledge and eclectic tastes. His juxtapositions -- the album swings from hip-hop to reggae to jangle-pop, and then all combines into one sound -- are wildly original, even if the music itself doesn't break through the confines of big beat. Then again, when a record is this forceful and catchy, it doesn't need to break new stylistic ground, the pleasure is in hearing a master work. And there's no question that Cook is a master of sorts, as You've Come a Long Way, Baby is a seamless record filled with great imagination, unexpected twists and turns, huge hooks, and great beats. It's the kind of record that gives big beat a good name. [You've Come a Long Way, Baby was issued in a \"clean\" version with all profanity removed.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

        "summary": "On their full-length debut, Glass Animals recall more than a few of their contemporaries: Foals, Alt-J, and especially Wild Beasts spring to mind as touchstones for the band's lush yet challenging mix of indie and electronic sounds (\"Hazey,\" meanwhile, suggests a collaboration between Massive Attack and Antony Hegarty). However, Zaba also shows what David Bayley and company bring to this style. Bayley, who produced the album, lavishes these songs with sonic details that are almost hallucinatory: the echoes that grace opening track \"Flip\" suggest a slow-motion reverie before the song locks into a louder, and arguably more predictable, rock groove, while \"Pools\" lives up to its name with its aquatic sound. All of Zaba is coated in dripping reverb that gives it a slippery feel that matches the effortless way Glass Animals slide between electric and electronic instrumentation. \"Intruxx\"'s looping beat sounds like a trip-hop rhythm translated into live percussion that sounds right at home next to \"Wyrd\"'s bubbly electronics. The band is often at its most fascinating when it conveys the chilled-out sophistication of dance music via rock, as on the low-slung groove of \"Toes\" or the rippling former single \"Black Mambo,\" which makes the most of the jazzy androgyny of Bayley's vocals. An equally strange and sexy debut, Zaba's most audacious moments suggest Glass Animals will be an even more compelling act next time around. ~ Heather Phares",
