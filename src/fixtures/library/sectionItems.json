        "title": "10cc",
        "summary": "Deriving their name from the metric total of semen ejaculated by the average male, the tongue-in-cheek British art-pop band 10cc comprised an all-star roster of Manchester-based musicians: vocalist/guitarist Graham Gouldman was a former member of the Mockingbirds and the author of hits for the Yardbirds, the Hollies, Herman's Hermits and Jeff Beck; singer/guitarist Eric Stewart was an alum of Wayne Fontana & the Mindbenders; and vocalists/multi-instrumentalists Kevin Godley and Lol Creme were both highly regarded studio players. Formed in 1970, 10cc began as a session unit dubbed Hotlegs; after establishing residence at Stewart's Strawberry Studios, Hotlegs scored a surprise U.K. smash with the single \"Neanderthal Man,\" subsequently issuing an LP, Thinks: School Times and touring with the Moody Blues.\r\nAfter signing to Jonathan King's U.K. label and rechristening themselves 10cc (a name suggested by King himself), the group backed Neil Sedaka before recording 1972's \"Donna,\" a sly satire of late-'50s doo wop. The single reached the number two position on the British charts, establishing not only a long-running string of major hits, but also the quartet's fondness for ironic and affectionate reclamations of musty pop styles. The follow-up, \"Rubber Bullets,\" topped the charts in 1973, and both the subsequent single \"The Dean and I\" (a nostalgic look at academia recalling Jerry Lee Lewis' \"High School Confidential\") and an eponymously titled debut LP further solidified 10cc as a major force in British pop. \r\nWhile 1974's Sheet Music and singles, including the Brian Wilson-esque \"Wall Street Shuffle,\" \"Silly Love\" and \"Life Is a Minestrone\" continued 10cc's dominance of the U.K. charts, they found the American market virtually impenetrable prior to the release of 1975's \"I'm Not in Love,\" which topped the charts at home and climbed as high as number two in the States. After 1975's Original Soundtrack and the next year's How Dare You!, Godley and Creme exited to focus on video production as well as developing the Gizmo, a guitar modification device the duo invented. In the wake of their departure, Gouldman and Stewart continued on alone, enlisting the aid of session men to record 1977's Deceptive Bends, highlighted by the perennial \"The Things We Do for Love.\"\r\nAfter recruiting guitarist Rick Fenn, keyboardist Tony O'Malley and drummer Stuart Tosh as full-time members, 10cc returned in 1978 with Bloody Tourists, which yielded the number one reggae nod \"Dreadlock Holiday.\" Following a series of unsuccessful efforts, including 1980s Look Hear?, 1981's 10 Out of 10 and 1983's Window in the Jungle, the group disbanded; while Stewart produced Sad Cafe and worked with Paul McCartney, Gouldman supervised recordings for the Ramones and Gilbert O'Sullivan before joining Andrew Gold in the duo Wax. In 1992, the original lineup of 10cc reunited for the LP Meanwhile, while only Gouldman and Stewart remained for 1993's Mirror Mirror. ~ Jason Ankeny",

        "summary": "Hailing from Manchester, U.K., the 1975 managed to combine the dark and youthful themes of sex, love, and fear with ethereal alt-rock music. The four-piece met at school in 2002, although lead singer and guitarist Matt Healy was born in London and drummer George Daniel was born across the North Sea in Brussels. The rest of the lineup was comprised of Adam Hann on guitar and bassist Ross MacDonald. The first incarnation of the band began by covering punk songs at gigs arranged for underage youths -- which would quickly descend into chaos. Influenced by a range of styles, from Michael Jackson, Motown, and the Rolling Stones to the soundscapes of Brian Eno, Boards of Canada, and Sigur Rós, they soon began to apply their pop-influenced hooks and guitar melodies to the lush ambient backdrops they created. \r\nIn 2012, they released their first EP, Facedown, on U.K. indie label Dirty Hit, and soon after supported Little Comets on their nationwide tour. The lead track from the debut EP, \"The City,\" was played on Huw Stephens' BBC Radio 1 show, and the quartet's energetic live performances endeared them to crowds, while their music began to sweep across music blogs. Toward the end of 2012 they released a second EP, entitled Sex, and the title track was played by influential BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe. The following year, a third EP appeared, titled Music for Cars, and spawned U.K. Top 20 single \"Chocolate.\" Their popularity continued to rise and they went on to play shows across the U.K. and were also invited to play at industry showcase SXSW in conjunction with a U.S. tour. Their self-titled debut -- recorded with producer Mike Crossey (Arctic Monkeys, Foals) -- was released in 2013. ~ Scott Kerr",

        "summary": "Hailing from the small town of Escatawpa, Mississippi, 3 Doors Down hit their peak in the early 2000s with a string of post-grunge singles, most notably \"Kryptonite,\" \"When I'm Gone,\" and the ballad \"Here Without You.\" \"Kryptonite,\" with its minor-key shuffle and references to Superman, was the catalyst for the band's career, generating an unprecedented buzz at a local radio station -- Biloxi's WCPR -- during the band's independent days. Such support helped make 3 Doors Down a regional favorite, enabling them to draw relatively large crowds to their local live shows and, consequently, extending their popularity beyond the Deep South to internationally famous clubs like New York's CBGB's.\r\nThe founding members of 3 Doors Down -- vocalist/drummer Brad Arnold, guitarist Matt Roberts, and bassist Todd Harrell -- were raised in Escatawpa, a cozy town of 8,000 people. Although brought up in religious households, the musicians also felt the call of rock & roll at an early age, eventually forming a rock trio in 1994 to play a friend's backyard party. As the years progressed, so did the band's sound, and the group soon added guitarist Chris Henderson and retained a studio drummer so that Arnold could come forward and sing live. After touring the Gulf Coast's venues, the band made its way to New York, where a showcase at CBGB's brought 3 Doors Down to the attention of Republic Records. A subsidiary of Universal, Republic Records signed the musicians and issued their major-label debut, The Better Life, in early 2000. \r\nThe Better Life became one of the biggest-selling albums of 2000, going platinum four times during its first year of release and spawning several singles. The band furthered its success with 2002's Away from the Sun, which debuted at number eight on the Billboard Top 200 and, like its predecessor, climbed to multi-platinum status. 3 Doors Down toured steadily throughout 2003 and 2004 in support of Away from the Sun, and issued the live EP Another 700 Miles in November 2003 as a holdover between studio efforts. The group returned with a heavier album, Seventeen Days, in early 2005. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and went platinum in its first week of release. A self-titled album, which followed in May 2008, repeated its predecessor's success when it too debuted at the top of the Billboard 200. \r\n3 Doors Down toured throughout 2009, released a digital-only acoustic holiday album at the end of the year, and began to work on their next album in 2010. With Howard Benson serving as producer, the guys shuttled themselves between L.A. and Tokyo, recording the album in both cities and eventually emerging with 2011's Time of My Life. ~ Stacia Proefrock",

        "title": "a-ha",
        "summary": "Pal Waaktaar and Magne Furuholmen, formerly of Bridges formed a-ha in the early '80s. Morten Harket joined the duo, and they left for the now \"legendary London flat\" (so called because of its state of disrepair) to make it. By late 1983 they had achieved part of that goal by signing to WEA. \"Take on Me\" took three times to become a hit in the U.K., eventually hitting number two in November 1985. Going one better in the U.S. mainly due to the wide exposure of its stunning video on MTV, which fused animation with real-life action, their only further hit there was \"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\" which became a U.K. number one in early 1986 helping take the album Hunting High and Low to the Top Ten. Mostly an album of synth pop, the press were quick to dismiss them as a teeny bop sensation; however, there was more to a-ha than met the ear in Waaktaar's writing, and a more mature effort, Scoundrel Days, was released in October, 1986. More focused, it had a stronger band feel thanks to its live drumming, displayed to great lengths on \"The Swing of Things and lead single \"I've Been Losing You\" -- a shock to critics at the time. Further striking imagery accompanied \"Cry Wolf.\" After a world tour, a-ha supplied the soundtrack to the James Bond flick The Living Daylights. A remix appeared on their third album, Stay on These Roads, in 1988. Considered lackluster, Stay on These Roads did feature some interesting lyrics in \"Blood That Moves the Body,\" regarding the over-intense affection the Japanese had for popular icons in their kamikaze-like suicides. On a lighter note, one of the famous quotes of this period came from Waaktaar: commenting on Def Leppard's success with Hysteria, he scoffed that a-ha were more rock & roll! In 1990, a-ha were commended by the Everly Brothers for their rendition of \"Crying in the Rain\" from their fourth album, East of the Sun, West of the Moon, which was largely ignored in the U.K. due to a shift in interests towards dance and the Manchester scene. 1993 heralded some much needed new blood in the U2 terrain of \"Dark Is the Night\" from the Memorial Beach album. Following the unfortunate lack of success following Memorial Beach, Furuholmen retreated into the art world while Waaktaar released the album Mary Is Coming with his new band Savoy. Seven years after the release of Memorial Beach, a-ha issued Minor Earth Major Sky in summer 2000. 2002's Lifelines sold well in Europe and was followed by a lengthy tour, documented on the live album How Can I Sleep with Your Voice in My Head, which was released in 2003. A year later the band celebrated their 20th anniversary by releasing Singles 1984-2004, a collection that would put them back on the U.K. Top 20 Albums chart. In July of 2005 the band performed in Berlin as part of the massive worldwide event Live8. In November they released the new album Analogue. It was supported by a world-wide tour that included gigs in Russia and a festival in Chile. The group's ninth studio album, Foot of the Mountain, was released in 2009. ~ Kelvin Hayes",
