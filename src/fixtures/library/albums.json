It's a task made even more difficult considering that, unlike violinist David Garrett's forays into classical rock, which add layers of orchestral production on top of his virtuoso skills, the two 24-year-olds' self-titled debut doesn't feature any other instruments. Luckily, the pair's masterful talents, which seem to produce sounds from a cello that otherwise wouldn't seem possible, more than make up for the lack of background support. Indeed, other than the deliberately sparse reworkings of Johnny Cash's rendition of \"Hurt\" and second Jackson interpretation \"Human Nature,\" its 12 tracks very rarely feel as stripped-back as one might expect, as the duo replicates the twanging guitar hook from Dick Dale's Pulp Fiction theme \"Misirlou,\" the crunching riffs of Nirvana's grunge classic \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" and the lilting piano chords of Muse's \"The Resistance,\" using a combination of plucking, bowing, and frantic strumming. While the bombastic treatments of \"Smooth Criminal\" and Guns N' Roses' \"Welcome to the Jungle\" have received all the attention, the whole concept is just as effective on the slower numbers, as they turn Sting's flamenco-tinged \"Fragile\" into a mournful Gypsy folk ballad and transform U2's \"With Or Without You\" into a poignant instrumental suitable for a soundtrack to a Jane Austen adaptation. The ambitious project only really falters on the one track, which on paper seems best suited to their craft, with their adaptation of \"Viva la Vida\" sounding surprisingly flat when compared to Coldplay's already string-soaked original. But 2Cellos is far from the classical karaoke affair one might have anticipated, as Sulic and Hauser have created an inventive first offering, with unique and innovative arrangements, that deserves to transcend their YouTube beginnings. ~ Jon O'Brien","index":1,"viewCount":19,"lastViewedAt":1481049596,"year":2014,"thumb":"/library/metadata/14276/thumb/1483217729","art":"/library/metadata/14275/art/1483888432","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/14275/thumb/1483888432","originallyAvailableAt":"2014-09-20","addedAt":1437907650,"updatedAt":1483217729,"Genre":[{"tag":"Cello Rock"}]},{"ratingKey":"6221","key":"/library/metadata/6221/children","parentRatingKey":"6220","studio":"Pias Recordings","type":"album","title":"3","parentKey":"/library/metadata/6220","parentTitle":"Nouvelle Vague","summary":"Producers Marc Collin and Olivier Libaux (working under the cover of Nouvelle Vague) shy away from the bossa nova that brought them acclaim and cover a wider variety of songs for this third album, adding several American pop tunes to the mix (such as \"Our Lips Are Sealed\" by the Go-Go's).

Singer/guitarist Israel Nebeker and drummer Ryan Dobrowski operate out of an acoustic setting but their mellow yet hooky tunes have more in common with indie rock outfits than folky troubadours. This Portland, OR-based group winds up being something like Beck or the Shins doing easygoing folksy tunes or Iron & Wine with a poppier sensibility. Whatever genre equation you want to use to describe them, it's easy to say that Blind Pilot have come up with a winning music plan. The opening tune \"Oviedo\" sets the course that they chart throughout the debut full-length. Against some laid-back guitar strumming and gentle drumming, Nebeker warmly sings his hazy but quirky lyrics, which seem like private language of personal confessions (\"Four times is once too much for luck and that's how many times the clock struck/I wandered home saying your name\"). As the song easies along, the arrangement gets fleshed out with muted horns and banjo picking. Nebeker nicely doubles his voice at times, but his singing maintains his intimate, hushed tones. In \"Paint or Pollen,\" he builds a set of beguiling images (\"Milk in your water, black in your primer, wood in your brush\") to express that \"the best is upon us.\" While having an interesting way with words, Nebeker isn't one for direct sentiment. He is a bit more overt in his affection on the title track, where he sings \"My eyes were dark 'till you woke me.\" While \"The Bitter End\" deals with death, it doesn't dip heavily in morbidity as Nebeker expresses his emotions through personal but semi-obscure references to \"hounds-tooth coats and vitamins.\" For all of its off-the-cuff musical vibe, Blind Pilot also exhibits a fine sense of craftsmanship. The vibraphone that weaves through \"One Red Thread\" subtly expands the song's sonic landscape while subdued horns show up again to bolster the woozy melody in \"I Buried a Bone.\" \"Two Towns from Me,\" meanwhile, feels like an indie pop tune performed at half-speed but works wonderfully in its own right. 3 Rounds and a Sound is one of those discs where the whole is greater than its parts. They may not be creating something wildly innovative, but Nebeker, Dobrowski, and their crew, in their own low-key way, have fashioned an impressive amalgam of rustic folk-pop and indie rock. They definitely have Blind Pilot headed in the right direction. ~ Michael Berick","index":1,"viewCount":31,"lastViewedAt":1483393372,"year":2008,"thumb":"/library/metadata/13223/thumb/1483483913","art":"/library/metadata/13211/art/1484147112","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/13211/thumb/1484147112","originallyAvailableAt":"2008-07-15","addedAt":1453887076,"updatedAt":1483483913,"Genre":[{"tag":"Indie Pop"},{"tag":"Indie Rock"}]},{"ratingKey":"8569","key":"/library/metadata/8569/children","parentRatingKey":"8566","type":"album","title":"30:30 Hindsight","parentKey":"/library/metadata/8566","parentTitle":"Jimmy Barnes","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":6,"lastViewedAt":1455272566,"year":2014,"thumb":"/library/metadata/8569/thumb/1483219430","art":"/library/metadata/8566/art/1483888655","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/8566/thumb/1483888655","originallyAvailableAt":"2014-08-29","addedAt":1438945565,"updatedAt":1483219430,"Genre":[{"tag":"Rock"},{"tag":"Soul"}]},{"ratingKey":"14181","key":"/library/metadata/14181/children","parentRatingKey":"14163","type":"album","title":"32 Golden Hits","parentKey":"/library/metadata/14163","parentTitle":"Acker Bilk","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":46,"lastViewedAt":1484130767,"year":2001,"thumb":"/library/metadata/14181/thumb/1483219610","art":"/library/metadata/14163/art/1483888737","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/14163/thumb/1483888737","originallyAvailableAt":"2001-06-01","addedAt":1444421380,"updatedAt":1483219610,"Genre":[{"tag":"Jazz"},{"tag":"Easy Listening"}]},{"ratingKey":"41768","key":"/library/metadata/41768/children","parentRatingKey":"4327","type":"album","title":"33 Resolutions Per Minute","parentKey":"/library/metadata/4327","parentTitle":"Scott Bradlee's Postmodern Jukebox","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":40,"lastViewedAt":1484334196,"thumb":"/library/metadata/4327/thumb/1484317164","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/4327/thumb/1484317164","addedAt":1483672416,"updatedAt":1483672454},{"ratingKey":"8210","key":"/library/metadata/8210/children","parentRatingKey":"8209","type":"album","title":"4 AM","parentKey":"/library/metadata/8209","parentTitle":"Kaskade","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":2,"lastViewedAt":1440270589,"year":2008,"thumb":"/library/metadata/8210/thumb/1483221735","art":"/library/metadata/8209/art/1483969544","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/8209/thumb/1483969544","originallyAvailableAt":"2008-04-18","addedAt":1437907650,"updatedAt":1483221735,"Genre":[{"tag":"House"}]},{"ratingKey":"5227","key":"/library/metadata/5227/children","parentRatingKey":"5226","studio":"Tru Thoughts","type":"album","title":"The 5th Exotic","titleSort":"5th Exotic","parentKey":"/library/metadata/5226","parentTitle":"Quantic","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":13,"lastViewedAt":1470654875,"year":2001,"thumb":"/library/metadata/5227/thumb/1483223105","art":"/library/metadata/5226/art/1484062792","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/5226/thumb/1484062792","originallyAvailableAt":"2001-06-18","addedAt":1437907650,"updatedAt":1483223105,"Genre":[{"tag":"Downtempo"},{"tag":"Chillout"}]},{"ratingKey":"844","key":"/library/metadata/844/children","parentRatingKey":"843","studio":"Elektra/Rhino/Warner/ATCO","type":"album","title":"90125","parentKey":"/library/metadata/843","parentTitle":"Yes","summary":"Rhino reissued expanded versions of all the Yes albums in the early days of the new millennium, so this 2013 set doesn't see either a massive sonic upgrade or expansion.

An interesting idea but the results are uncomfortable and not too appealing. ~ Scott Yanow","index":1,"viewCount":38,"lastViewedAt":1482451480,"year":1987,"thumb":"/library/metadata/3465/thumb/1483219511","art":"/library/metadata/3458/art/1483888719","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/3458/thumb/1483888719","originallyAvailableAt":"1987-10-20","addedAt":1452150501,"updatedAt":1483219511,"Genre":[{"tag":"Psychedelic Rock"},{"tag":"Psychedelic"},{"tag":"Rock"}]},{"ratingKey":"40318","key":"/library/metadata/40318/children","parentRatingKey":"40317","type":"album","title":"About a Feeling","parentKey":"/library/metadata/40317","parentTitle":"Summer Heart","summary":"","index":1,"userRating":10.0,"viewCount":13,"lastViewedAt":1482641806,"year":2012,"thumb":"/library/metadata/40318/thumb/1483223847","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/40317/thumb/1484063182","originallyAvailableAt":"2012-04-25","addedAt":1479374601,"updatedAt":1483223847,"Genre":[{"tag":"Electronic"},{"tag":"Chillwave"}]},{"ratingKey":"34543","key":"/library/metadata/34543/children","parentRatingKey":"34542","studio":"Pieater","type":"album","title":"About Face","parentKey":"/library/metadata/34542","parentTitle":"#1 Dads","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":54,"lastViewedAt":1483833007,"year":2014,"thumb":"/library/metadata/34543/thumb/1483217031","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/34542/thumb/1483888427","originallyAvailableAt":"2014-08-08","addedAt":1472548716,"updatedAt":1483217031,"Genre":[{"tag":"Indie Rock"}]},{"ratingKey":"4481","key":"/library/metadata/4481/children","parentRatingKey":"4406","studio":"Columbia/Legacy","type":"album","title":"Abraxas","parentKey":"/library/metadata/4406","parentTitle":"Santana","summary":"The San Francisco Bay Area rock scene of the late '60s was one that encouraged radical experimentation and discouraged the type of mindless conformity that's often plagued corporate rock. When one considers just how different Santana, Jefferson Airplane, Moby Grape, and the Grateful Dead sounded, it becomes obvious just how much it was encouraged. In the mid-'90s, an album as eclectic as Abraxas would be considered a marketing exec's worst nightmare. But at the dawn of the 1970s, this unorthodox mix of rock, jazz, salsa, and blues proved quite successful. Whether adding rock elements to salsa king Tito Puente's \"Oye Como Va,\" embracing instrumental jazz-rock on \"Incident at Neshabur\" and \"Samba Pa Ti,\" or tackling moody blues-rock on Fleetwood Mac's \"Black Magic Woman,\" the band keeps things unpredictable yet cohesive. Many of the Santana albums that came out in the '70s are worth acquiring, but for novices, Abraxas is an excellent place to start. [Columbia/Legacy's 1998 reissue of Abraxas featured three previously unreleased tracks -- \"Se a Cabo,\" \"Toussaint l'Overture,\" \"Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen\" -- which were all recorded live at the Royal Albert Hall on April 18, 1970.] ~ Alex Henderson","index":1,"viewCount":16,"lastViewedAt":1480385590,"year":1970,"thumb":"/library/metadata/4481/thumb/1483223445","art":"/library/metadata/4406/art/1484062941","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/4406/thumb/1484062941","originallyAvailableAt":"1970-11-16","addedAt":1437907650,"updatedAt":1483223445,"Genre":[{"tag":"Acid Rock"},{"tag":"Psychedelic"},{"tag":"Rock"}]},{"ratingKey":"31548","key":"/library/metadata/31548/children","parentRatingKey":"18948","studio":"Flying Nun Records","type":"album","title":"Absolute Truth","parentKey":"/library/metadata/18948","parentTitle":"Lawrence Arabia","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":21,"lastViewedAt":1483412152,"year":2016,"thumb":"/library/metadata/31548/thumb/1483221906","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/18948/thumb/1483969666","originallyAvailableAt":"2016-01-01","addedAt":1468294906,"updatedAt":1483221906,"Genre":[{"tag":"General Indie Pop"},{"tag":"Indie Pop"},{"tag":"Indie"}]},{"ratingKey":"7607","key":"/library/metadata/7607/children","parentRatingKey":"7606","studio":"Glassnote","type":"album","title":"Absolute Zero","parentKey":"/library/metadata/7606","parentTitle":"Little Green Cars","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":17,"lastViewedAt":1478896616,"year":2013,"thumb":"/library/metadata/7607/thumb/1483222008","art":"/library/metadata/7606/art/1483969710","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/7606/thumb/1483969710","originallyAvailableAt":"2013-03-26","addedAt":1460961756,"updatedAt":1483222008,"Genre":[{"tag":"Brit Rock"},{"tag":"British Indie Rock/Pop"},{"tag":"Indie"}]},{"ratingKey":"13477","key":"/library/metadata/13477/children","parentRatingKey":"13476","studio":"NBD Music","type":"album","title":"Absolutes","parentKey":"/library/metadata/13476","parentTitle":"Barcelona","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":4,"lastViewedAt":1463275178,"year":2007,"thumb":"/library/metadata/13477/thumb/1483219459","art":"/library/metadata/13476/art/1483888656","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/13476/thumb/1483888656","originallyAvailableAt":"2007-09-25","addedAt":1452391365,"updatedAt":1483219459,"Genre":[{"tag":"Rock"},{"tag":"Indie Rock"}]},{"ratingKey":"6612","key":"/library/metadata/6612/children","parentRatingKey":"6583","studio":"Mushroom","type":"album","title":"Absolution","parentKey":"/library/metadata/6583","parentTitle":"Muse","summary":"Muse lead vocalist Matthew Bellamy's vocal timbre bears some similarity to that of Thom Yorke, leading some to dismiss Muse as simply a band of Radiohead worshipers.

Employing a daring mix of classical-influenced piano and strings, metallic guitars, unabashedly strident house-style synths, and the type of production bombast usually reserved for Queen or ELO, Muse often sound like an otherworldly jam session between Rufus Wainwright, the Move, and Evanescence.

Building on previous highlights like \"The Ghost Inside\" and \"The High Road,\" the pair dive deeper into their synth pop, new wave, and disco fascinations to soundtrack songs that, as the album title suggests, are filled with comedowns and disappointments. Former single and standout track \"Holding on for Life\" uses its slow-motion disco beat and eerie keyboards to underscore the emptiness lurking in lyrics like \"what a lovely day to be lonely,\" cultivating a mood that falls somewhere between desperate and glamorous. As always in Broken Bells' world, there's a fine line between bittersweet and bummed out; while these aren't the easiest moods to make appealing, Burton and Mercer succeed when they bring some energy to the proceedings. \"Medicine\" bolsters its contemplative sighs with spiky, percussive pop that recalls Gotye, while \"No Matter What You're Told\" gives some brassy bite to its blasÃ© cynicism. Here and on songs like \"Lazy Wonderland,\" which sells the merits of watching the wheels go round and round with some alluring major-minor chord changes, After the Disco feels like a much more organic and satisfying blend of Mercer and Burton's respective strengths than Broken Bells did. However, the duo still sometimes border on being too tasteful, and much of the album's pleasure comes from appreciating flourishes like the flute-like keys on \"Leave It Alone\" and the update of smoky '70s soft rock on \"The Angel and the Fool\" rather than the songs' actual sentiments; even the title of the closing track, \"The Remains of Rock & Roll,\" suggests that passion doesn't have much of a place here. Given Burton and Mercer's pedigrees, it's hard not to want more from Broken Bells, but After the Disco's strongest moments suggest that their music is coming into focus.

His two compositions on the Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album DÃ©jÃ  Vu, \"Helpless\" and \"Country Girl,\" returned him to the folk and country styles he had pursued before delving into the hard rock of Everybody Knows; two other singles, \"Sugar Mountain\" and \"Oh, Lonesome Me,\" also emphasized those roots. But \"Ohio,\" a CSNY single, rocked as hard as anything on the second album. After the Gold Rush was recorded with the aid of Nils Lofgren, a 17-year-old unknown whose piano was a major instrument, turning one of the few real rockers, \"Southern Man\" (which had unsparing protest lyrics typical of Phil Ochs), into a more stately effort than anything on the previous album and giving a classic tone to the title track, a mystical ballad that featured some of Young's most imaginative lyrics and became one of his most memorable songs. But much of After the Gold Rush consisted of country-folk love songs, which consolidated the audience Young had earned through his tours and recordings with CSNY; its dark yet hopeful tone matched the tenor of the times in 1970, making it one of the definitive singer/songwriter albums, and it has remained among Young's major achievements. ~ William Ruhlmann","index":1,"viewCount":42,"lastViewedAt":1483554442,"year":1970,"thumb":"/library/metadata/6396/thumb/1483224460","art":"/library/metadata/6395/art/1484063473","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/6395/thumb/1484063473","originallyAvailableAt":"1970-09-19","addedAt":1452150501,"updatedAt":1483224460,"Genre":[{"tag":"Country Rock"},{"tag":"Rock"}]},{"ratingKey":"6860","key":"/library/metadata/6860/children","parentRatingKey":"6859","studio":"Warner Bros.","type":"album","title":"After the Snow","parentKey":"/library/metadata/6859","parentTitle":"Modern English","summary":"\"I Melt with You\" will forever be the one specific moment that's Modern English's place in pop history, but the album it came from, After the Snow, isn't anything to sneeze at either. Indeed, in transforming from the quite fine but dour young miserabilists on Mesh & Lace to a brighter incarnation who still had a melancholy side, the quintet found exactly the right combination best-suited for their abilities. Like contemporaries B-Movie and the Sound, Modern English used punk and post-punk roots as a chance to introduce a haunting, beautiful take on romance and emotion, while the contributions of Stephen Walker on keyboard helped make the album both of its time and timeless. That said, the secret weapon on the album is the rhythm section of Michael Conroy and Richard Brown, able to shift from the polite but relentless tribal beat clatter on the excellent \"Life in the Gladhouse\" to the ever more intense punch of the title track, the album's unheralded masterpiece. None of this is to denigrate the contributions of singer Robbie Grey and guitarist Gary McDowell. The former's seemingly mannered singing actually shows a remarkable fluidity at points -- \"After the Snow\" again is a good reference point, as is the fraught, slow-burn epic \"Dawn Chorus\" -- while McDowell works around the band's various arrangements instead of trying to dominate them. Some songs, like \"Face of Wood,\" even find Modern English -- often dogged with Joy Division comparisons early on -- predicting where New Order would go before that band got there itself. Still, \"I Melt with You\" is the main reason most will want to investigate further. A perfect pop moment that didn't have to strain for it, its balance of giddy sentiment and heartfelt passion matched with a rush of acoustic and electric guitar overdubs just can't be beat. ~ Ned Raggett","index":1,"viewCount":2,"lastViewedAt":1465969305,"year":1982,"thumb":"/library/metadata/6860/thumb/1483222351","art":"/library/metadata/6859/art/1483969896","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/6859/thumb/1483969896","originallyAvailableAt":"1982-01-01","addedAt":1437907650,"updatedAt":1483222351,"Genre":[{"tag":"Alternative"}]},{"ratingKey":"6556","key":"/library/metadata/6556/children","parentRatingKey":"6555","studio":"CDBaby","type":"album","title":"After Winter Must Come Spring","parentKey":"/library/metadata/6555","parentTitle":"My Dad Vs Yours","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":2,"lastViewedAt":1451359969,"year":2006,"thumb":"/library/metadata/6556/thumb/1483222575","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/6555/thumb/1483969959","originallyAvailableAt":"2006-01-01","addedAt":1437907650,"updatedAt":1483222575,"Genre":[{"tag":"Electronic"}]},{"ratingKey":"2016","key":"/library/metadata/2016/children","parentRatingKey":"2004","studio":"London","type":"album","title":"Aftermath","parentKey":"/library/metadata/2004","parentTitle":"The Rolling Stones","summary":"The Rolling Stones finally delivered a set of all-original material with Aftermath, which also did much to define the group as the bad boys of rock & roll, with their sneering attitude toward the world in general and the female sex in particular. The borderline misogyny could get a bit juvenile in tunes like \"Stupid Girl.\" But on the other hand the group began incorporating the influences of psychedelia and Dylan into their material with classics like \"Paint It, Black,\" an eerily insistent number one hit graced by some of the best use of sitar (played by Brian Jones) on a rock record. Other classics included the jazzy \"Under My Thumb,\" where Jones added exotic accents with his vibes, and the delicate Elizabethan ballad \"Lady Jane,\" where dulcimer can be heard. Some of the material is fairly ho-hum, to be honest, as Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were still prone to inconsistent songwriting; \"Goin' Home,\" an 11-minute blues jam, was remarkable, more for its barrier-crashing length than its content.

It's hard not to feel that this work ethic rubbed off on his solo career: Hammond made AHJ an EP instead of another full-length in order to showcase his best songs -- a markedly different approach than he took on his previous solo work, where his let-it-all-hang-out aesthetic was a big part of the charm. Producer Gus Oberg, who also helped craft the Strokes' 2010s albums, helps Hammond forge a sound that complements his previous solo work as well as his legacy with that band. The brittle riff that begins \"St. Justice\" is unmistakably Hammond, and much more guitar-driven than the music his main band was making at the time. Â¿Como Te Llama? already had a handful of songs that recalled the Strokes, so AHJ's focus on that side of Hammond's music feels natural, and at times even more inspired than the band's latter-day material. The Strokes' best songs generated sparks with the friction of their cheeky and heartfelt impulses, and while Hammond is more earnest here than the Strokes ever were, or on his earlier work for that matter, there's a similar tug of war between AHJ's bouncy veneers and melancholy undercurrents. This is especially true of the EP's standout track, \"Strange Tidings,\" which feels more intimate and confessional in its recriminations (\"Watch what you say/If I'm guilty, I will pay\") than the similarly moody songs by his other band. Though the EP format doesn't leave much room for dabbling or dawdling, Hammond does find time to temper his newfound clarity with a little of his old mischief on \"Rude Customer,\" a blend of rip-roaring guitars and clipped, almost British-sounding vocals. Jaunty and jagged, AHJ is easily Hammond's most consistent release. For perhaps the first time, his solo work feels less like a tangent to his work with the Strokes and more like something sustainable in its own right. ~ Heather Phares","index":1,"viewCount":4,"lastViewedAt":1475471885,"year":2013,"thumb":"/library/metadata/34896/thumb/1483221183","art":"/library/metadata/14114/art/1483969266","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/14114/thumb/1483969266","originallyAvailableAt":"2013-10-08","addedAt":1473332516,"updatedAt":1483221183,"Genre":[{"tag":"Rock"},{"tag":"Alternative Rock"}]},{"ratingKey":"31486","key":"/library/metadata/31486/children","parentRatingKey":"31464","studio":"Om Records","type":"album","title":"Air Farina","parentKey":"/library/metadata/31464","parentTitle":"Mark Farina","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":11,"lastViewedAt":1482994720,"year":2003,"thumb":"/library/metadata/31486/thumb/1483221541","art":"/library/metadata/31464/art/1483969453","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/31464/thumb/1483969453","originallyAvailableAt":"2003-10-07","addedAt":1468294897,"updatedAt":1483221541,"Genre":[{"tag":"House"},{"tag":"Acid Jazz"}]},{"ratingKey":"33182","key":"/library/metadata/33182/children","parentRatingKey":"12567","studio":"Cheers Elephant","type":"album","title":"Airliner","parentKey":"/library/metadata/12567","parentTitle":"Cheers Elephant","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":2,"lastViewedAt":1473844774,"year":2015,"thumb":"/library/metadata/33182/thumb/1483220041","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/12567/thumb/1483888986","originallyAvailableAt":"2015-01-01","addedAt":1469993479,"updatedAt":1483220041,"Genre":[{"tag":"General Alternative Rock"},{"tag":"Alt-Rock"},{"tag":"Alternative"}]},{"ratingKey":"4009","key":"/library/metadata/4009/children","parentRatingKey":"4008","studio":"MCA Records","type":"album","title":"Aja","parentKey":"/library/metadata/4008","parentTitle":"Steely Dan","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":2,"lastViewedAt":1467864888,"year":1977,"thumb":"/library/metadata/4009/thumb/1483223771","art":"/library/metadata/4008/art/1484063132","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/4008/thumb/1484063132","originallyAvailableAt":"1977-09-23","addedAt":1452150501,"updatedAt":1483223771,"Genre":[{"tag":"Classic Soft Rock"},{"tag":"Rock"}]},{"ratingKey":"1106","key":"/library/metadata/1106/children","parentRatingKey":"1105","studio":"Altafonte Music Distribution, S.L.","type":"album","title":"Akapellando","parentKey":"/library/metadata/1105","parentTitle":"Vocal Sampling","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":21,"lastViewedAt":1484250024,"year":2008,"thumb":"/library/metadata/1106/thumb/1483224124","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/1105/thumb/1484063335","originallyAvailableAt":"2008-02-04","addedAt":1451947167,"updatedAt":1483224124,"Genre":[{"tag":"Club Dance"},{"tag":"Dance Club"},{"tag":"Dance & House"}]},{"ratingKey":"1387","key":"/library/metadata/1387/children","parentRatingKey":"1386","studio":"Sequoia Records","type":"album","title":"Akwaba","parentKey":"/library/metadata/1386","parentTitle":"Tya","summary":"TYA is the stage name of one Maertin Scherl, a German keyboardist and programmer with an affinity for the music of aboriginal Australia and access to samples of singers like the Bulgarian Voices, Sarband, and Trinovox. And yes, the rational response to that information would be to say, \"Oh good, another German electronica artist with Third World pretensions.\" But if you hold your perfectly reasonable suspicions in abeyance for about 15 minutes, Scherl may well win you over with his nicely developed melodies, subdued but funky beats, and complex sonic textures. (Maybe not so much with the ocean and forest sounds, which are supposed to evoke a knee-jerk purchasing reaction in right-thinking people everywhere.) What makes this music so attractive is Scherl's two-pronged strategy of bringing the beats right up to the front, and finding good singers to sample and using the samples well. Notice, for example, the combination of African and European voices on \"Coming Home\" and the dubwise treatment he applies to the gorgeous choral singers on \"Mama.\" Whether or not you buy into the utopian visions of global oneness that give rise to music like this, the music itself is quite special. ~ Rick Anderson","index":1,"viewCount":2,"lastViewedAt":1452036830,"year":2004,"thumb":"/library/metadata/1387/thumb/1483224065","originallyAvailableAt":"2004-01-01","addedAt":1437907650,"updatedAt":1483224065,"Genre":[{"tag":"Ethnic"}]},{"ratingKey":"722","key":"/library/metadata/722/children","parentRatingKey":"639","studio":"Scotti Bros.","type":"album","title":"Alapalooza","parentKey":"/library/metadata/639","parentTitle":"âWeird Alâ Yankovic","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":4,"lastViewedAt":1478561873,"year":1993,"thumb":"/library/metadata/722/thumb/1483224359","art":"/library/metadata/639/art/1484063441","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/639/thumb/1484063441","originallyAvailableAt":"1993-10-05","addedAt":1458645090,"updatedAt":1483224359,"Genre":[{"tag":"Comedy"},{"tag":"Parody"}]},{"ratingKey":"40172","key":"/library/metadata/40172/children","parentRatingKey":"40171","studio":"INgrooves","type":"album","title":"The Albatross","titleSort":"Albatross","parentKey":"/library/metadata/40171","parentTitle":"Foxing","summary":"","index":1,"year":2013,"thumb":"/library/metadata/40172/thumb/1483220879","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/40171/thumb/1483889409","originallyAvailableAt":"2013-11-12","addedAt":1478928251,"updatedAt":1483220879,"Genre":[{"tag":"Post-Rock"},{"tag":"Emo"}]},{"ratingKey":"14100","key":"/library/metadata/14100/children","parentRatingKey":"14099","studio":"Inertia Pty Ltd","type":"album","title":"Alexander","parentKey":"/library/metadata/14099","parentTitle":"Alexander Ebert","summary":"","index":1,"userRating":10.0,"viewCount":30,"lastViewedAt":1482820791,"year":2011,"thumb":"/library/metadata/14100/thumb/1483220539","art":"/library/metadata/14099/art/1483889278","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/14099/thumb/1483889278","originallyAvailableAt":"2011-03-01","addedAt":1462709770,"updatedAt":1483220539,"Genre":[{"tag":"General Alternative Rock"},{"tag":"Alt-Rock"},{"tag":"Alternative"}]},{"ratingKey":"40374","key":"/library/metadata/40374/children","parentRatingKey":"40371","type":"album","title":"Alio","parentKey":"/library/metadata/40371","parentTitle":"Fort Frances","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":30,"lastViewedAt":1484083310,"year":2016,"thumb":"/library/metadata/40374/thumb/1483220859","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/40371/thumb/1483889400","originallyAvailableAt":"2016-01-01","addedAt":1479374646,"updatedAt":1483220859,"Genre":[{"tag":"General Indie Rock"},{"tag":"Indie Rock"},{"tag":"Indie"}]},{"ratingKey":"12083","key":"/library/metadata/12083/children","parentRatingKey":"12045","studio":"EMI Music Japan","type":"album","title":"Alive 2007","parentKey":"/library/metadata/12045","parentTitle":"Daft Punk","summary":"In 2001, Parisian house duo Daft Punk released a best-selling live album (Alive 1997) recorded at the height of their commercial success.

Once again showcasing the combined talents of Ted Joyner and Grant Widmer, Alix is a catchy, brightly colored affair with songs built largely around the duo's yearning, nasally vocals, buoyant synth lines, and dance-oriented, if not exactly club-ready, beats. In some ways, the album picks up on the languid, late-summer vibe of 2013's Heza, taking it even further with dreamy, melancholy cuts like \"Now Look at Me,\" and the fuzzy, bubbly \"Black Lemon.\" Also similar to the group's past albums, Alix sounds a lot like a lost synth pop album from the early '80s, full of melodic, lightly arty cuts that bring to mind such vintage influences as Tom Tom Club, Nu Shooz, and Thomas Dolby. That said, Alix is anything but a retro album and cuts like the '50s-infused \"Gold Silver Diamond,\" and the clipped, new wave-inflected \"Charlemagne\" also fit nicely alongside such similarly leaning contemporary acts as MGMT, Phoenix, Fun. and Passion Pit. Ultimately, with Alix, Generationals deliver quirky, catchy pop songs that stick in your head like DayGlo bubblegum on a hot summer parking lot.

Unwind","parentKey":"/library/metadata/41632","parentTitle":"My Brightest Diamond","summary":"Beginning with 2006âs hauntingly beautiful Bring Me the Workhorse and continuing with the ambitiously orchestrated A Thousand Sharkâs Teeth two years later, My Brightest Diamondâs Shara Worden offers her most complex and fully realized work yet with All Things Will Unwind. In collaborating with the acclaimed yMusic chamber ensemble, a surprisingly natural partnership is born, as the group lends textured orchestral flourishes -- whimsical woodwind trills, majestic horns, gamelan-esque percussion -- that punctuate and elevate Wordenâs soaring, operatically trained vocals. The record feels cinematic; each track has a singular sense of drama, conjuring the poignancy of Antony and the Johnsons, passion of Edith Piaf, and eclecticism of Regina Spektor, flowing together into a lush, stirring study in art pop. Since recording A Thousand Sharkâs Teeth, Worden has returned to her native Southeast Michigan, and the influence of Detroit as a microcosm of cross-country Obama-era issues comes to bear here. As she sings \"We added up to zero/...What a pair of agreeable disagreeables\" in the cabaret-like \"We Added It Up,\" partisan political struggles come to mind, while the almost twee \"Thereâs a Rat\" employs animal characters to address the economic crisis and \"High Low Middle\" takes the form of an old-time protest song about unemployment. In the wrong hands, this could come across as preaching from the soapbox, but Wordenâs unique vision lends courage, vulnerability, and heart instead. And just as the political was an influence here, so too was the personal: as Worden had her first child in summer 2010, she delivers a message in utero with \"Reaching Through to the Other Side,\" and on the ethereal \"I Have Never Loved Someone the Way I Love You\" ponders the eternal nature of the heart, promising \"When I grow to be a poppy in the graveyard/I will send you all my love upon the breeze.\" All Things Will Unwind finds this musical auteur at the top of her game, maturing, pushing her already broad boundaries, and brimming with imagination. ~ Chrysta Cherrie","index":1,"viewCount":1,"lastViewedAt":1483436338,"year":2011,"thumb":"/library/metadata/41633/thumb/1483222572","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/41632/thumb/1483969952","originallyAvailableAt":"2011-10-18","addedAt":1483168013,"updatedAt":1483222572,"Genre":[{"tag":"Indie Pop"}]},{"ratingKey":"13434","key":"/library/metadata/13434/children","parentRatingKey":"13433","studio":"Universal","type":"album","title":"All This Bad Blood","parentKey":"/library/metadata/13433","parentTitle":"Bastille","summary":"Bad Blood reveals that Bastille is a synth-driven band that isn't particularly arty, something of a rarity during the electronic pop revival of the 2000s and 2010s. Where many of their contemporaries used the glamour of synth-pop's '80s heyday and electronic music's infinite possibilities to craft shiny pop fantasies, Bastille builds on the glossy, anthemic approach they set forth on the Laura Palmer EP (the title track, which is included here, might also be the least arty song inspired by David Lynch's surreal soap opera Twin Peaks). Early highlights like \"Pompeii,\" \"These Streets,\" and the title track boast panoramic choruses and sleek arrangements that hint at a kinship with Empire of the Sun and Delphic, while the handclaps and popping bassline on the otherwise moody \"Icarus\" recall Hot Chip at their most confessional. However, most of Bad Blood suggests that Bastille are actually an electronically enhanced upgrade of sweeping British pop traditionalists like Keane or Coldplay. The band updates \"Oblivion\"'s piano balladry with ping-ponging drums and contrasts Dan Smith's throaty singing and searching lyrics (\"There's a hole in my soul/Can you fill it?\") with a tumbling  beat on \"Flaws.\" Like the aforementioned acts, Bastille has a way with heartfelt melodies and choruses that resonate, particularly on the driving \"Things We Lost in the Fire\" and \"Get Home,\" where the slightly processed vocals also evoke Sia, Imogen Heap, and other electronic-friendly singer/songwriters. While the band occasionally gets a little too self-serious on the album's second half, Bad Blood is a solid, polished debut that fans of acts like Snow Patrol (who don't mind more electronics in the mix) might appreciate more than synth-pop aficionados.

Using his gift for making any album he works on sound effortless, Taveniere helps them embrace Almanac's velvety country and classic rock even more fully and naturally, with results that sound more fresh-faced than theatrical. Compared to the duo's other albums, All Yours is downright restrained: \"Hands\" echoes the gentle drift of their debut even though it glides along on tasteful strings and keyboards instead of distorted guitars, while \"Narrows\" transforms the duo's lingering shoegaze impulses into shimmering drones. However, this pared-down approach makes room for Widowspeak's increasing twang to emerge even more confidently on the title track, as well as for more adventurous moves like \"My Baby's Gonna Carry On,\" which uses '60s and '70s psych-rock trappings -- a \"Sunshine Superman\" bassline, rippling Rhodes fills, and busy percussion -- in ways that sound remarkably ungimmicky. All Yours also puts the spotlight on just how much Widowspeak's songwriting has grown over the years; \"Coke Bottle Green\" is a fascinating combination of traditional country and folk structure and 21st century domesticity (\"I want windows I can fill/With any life I can't kill\"). Like Fleetwood Mac, whose influence permeated Almanac, Hamilton and Thomas excel at setting heartbroken lyrics to addictively catchy melodies. All Yours is filled with painful memories lying just underneath its honeyed surface; \"Dead Love (You're So Still)\" cloaks frustration with an old flame in head-bobbing hooks. Hamilton sounds as sweet as ever on these barbed, ambivalent songs, whether she's lamenting a galaxy's worth of emotional distance on \"Cosmically Aligned\" or chasing a feeling as fleeting as a high on the gorgeous \"Stoned.\" Nevertheless, her most thoughtful lyrics aren't about a lover, but her relationship to other, younger women: as she sings \"Further from my wilder years/I get kinder to the younger girls\" over guitars that burn like a grudge, \"Girls\" illustrates the dance between jealousy and affection simply and brilliantly. Moments like these make All Yours Widowspeak's most self-assured and vulnerable album yet. ~ Heather Phares","index":1,"viewCount":1,"lastViewedAt":1479963420,"year":2015,"thumb":"/library/metadata/35316/thumb/1483224222","art":"/library/metadata/35315/art/1484063387","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/35315/thumb/1484063387","originallyAvailableAt":"2015-01-01","addedAt":1473509783,"updatedAt":1483224222,"Genre":[{"tag":"Dream Pop"}]},{"ratingKey":"14051","key":"/library/metadata/14051/children","parentRatingKey":"14050","studio":"Innovative Leisure","type":"album","title":"Allah-Las","parentKey":"/library/metadata/14050","parentTitle":"Allah-Las","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":70,"lastViewedAt":1483569688,"year":2012,"thumb":"/library/metadata/14051/thumb/1483219154","art":"/library/metadata/14050/art/1483888470","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/14050/thumb/1483888470","originallyAvailableAt":"2012-09-18","addedAt":1464992471,"updatedAt":1483219154,"Genre":[{"tag":"Garage Rock"},{"tag":"Surf Rock"}]},{"ratingKey":"9930","key":"/library/metadata/9930/children","parentRatingKey":"9896","studio":"Nonesuch","type":"album","title":"Allegria","parentKey":"/library/metadata/9896","parentTitle":"Gipsy Kings","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":1,"lastViewedAt":1463101496,"year":1982,"thumb":"/library/metadata/9930/thumb/1483221035","art":"/library/metadata/9896/art/1483889479","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/9896/thumb/1483889479","originallyAvailableAt":"1982-01-01","addedAt":1451949168,"updatedAt":1483221035,"Genre":[{"tag":"Ethnic Fusion Pop"},{"tag":"Other Pop"},{"tag":"Pop"}]},{"ratingKey":"38218","key":"/library/metadata/38218/children","parentRatingKey":"38217","studio":"Saddle Creek","type":"album","title":"Alligator Years","parentKey":"/library/metadata/38217","parentTitle":"Twinsmith","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":3,"lastViewedAt":1482983495,"year":2015,"thumb":"/library/metadata/38218/thumb/1483224049","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/38217/thumb/1484063286","originallyAvailableAt":"2015-01-01","addedAt":1478117580,"updatedAt":1483224049,"Genre":[{"tag":"General Alternative Rock"},{"tag":"Alt-Rock"},{"tag":"Alternative"}]},{"ratingKey":"32908","key":"/library/metadata/32908/children","parentRatingKey":"32907","studio":"Essential Music and Marketing Ltd","type":"album","title":"Alone Aboard the Ark","parentKey":"/library/metadata/32907","parentTitle":"The Leisure Society","summary":"","index":1,"userRating":8.0,"viewCount":42,"lastViewedAt":1483263473,"year":2013,"thumb":"/library/metadata/32908/thumb/1483221967","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/32907/thumb/1483969672","originallyAvailableAt":"2013-04-01","addedAt":1469993428,"updatedAt":1483221967,"Genre":[{"tag":"Indie Pop"},{"tag":"Indie Folk"}]},{"ratingKey":"11181","key":"/library/metadata/11181/children","parentRatingKey":"11142","studio":"Columbia Records","type":"album","title":"Alone in the Universe","parentKey":"/library/metadata/11142","parentTitle":"Electric Light Orchestra","summary":"Alone in the Universe isn't the first Jeff Lynne album of the 21st century, nor is it the first Electric Light Orchestra of the 21st century. That honor belongs to Zoom, a 2001 comeback that faded quickly into history books, its lack of success blamed in some quarters on Lynne's reluctance to tour. If Jeff didn't want to hit the road, his old bandmate Bev Bevan had no problem constituting a lineup and touring under the name ELO Part II, whose presence somewhat explains why Alone in the Universe is credited to the somewhat convoluted Jeff Lynne's ELO -- a truncation of the band's full name that also assigns credit where it's due, as most listeners associate this majestic post-Abbey Road pop with Lynne alone. Certainly, Alone in the Universe is recognizably the work of Lynne: harmonies so sweet they'd induce cavities, stately midtempo marches that just avoid the appearance of pomp, a devotion to both McCartney-esque melody and Martin-esque production, spiked by an ode to George Harrison's slide guitar. At 32 minutes, Alone in the Universe is remarkably devoid of excess -- notably, it's just five minutes longer than his breezy 2012 covers album Long Wave -- but it doesn't feel shrugged off, nor does it feel especially attached to its time. Lynne abandons some of the clean-cut sharp edges of his early-'90s productions so he can happily live in the late '70s -- there are echoes of disco on \"One Step at a Time\" and the entire enterprise carries a sci-fi aura, even if it never is fantastical or prog -- and there's an appeal to his long looks back because he's not pandering to nostalgia: he's simply embracing who he is. If he hasn't written a knockout single -- a high bar for a craftsman of 67 to clear -- he's nevertheless sculpted ten strong songs, each one containing a sturdy melodic foundation and dressed in the handsomest threads of 1978. For many longtime followers of Lynne and ELO, that will be all they need from Alone in the Universe.

The band call on inspiration from the jangly C-86 movement and bands like the Wedding Present or Talulah Gosh, but also lean on the fuzzy, homespun spirit of early American independent bedroom pop and twee while steeping their tunes in a languid dreaminess borrowed from Teenage Fanclub at their most wistful. The album opens with the one-two punch of \"Adult Diversion\" and \"Archie, Marry Me,\" two single-worthy songs of noisy guitars, gloriously deadpan vocal harmonies, and sticky melodies cemented in the listener's skull by the interplay between guitar and singer Molly Rankin's cascading vocals. The album is full of highlights, from the synthy melancholia of \"Party Police\" to the Orange Juice-esque interweaving guitar lines of \"Atop a Cake.\" While Alvvays relies on the same reverb-heavy production that an entire generation of beach-obsessed indie pop bands has tended toward, they surpass many of their peers by delivering more inspired songs, often with unexpected shifts or breakthrough moments. This debut surpasses simply being \"promising\" by delivering pop as beautifully composed as that of contemporaries like Pains of Being Pure at Heart or Veronica Falls, while also tying in sentiments of punk gusto, twee wonderment, and dream pop thoughtfulness without relying strictly on the musical blueprints of any of those genres. Instead, Alvvays find a way to articulate their heart-struck, dream-like songs with deft intention and control.

American Idiot is an unapologetic, unabashed rock opera, a form that Pete Townshend pioneered with Tommy, but Green Day doesn't use that for a blueprint as much as they use the Who's mini-opera \"A Quick One, While He's Away,\" whose whirlwind succession of 90-second songs isn't only emulated on two song suites here, but provides the template for the larger 13-song cycle. But the Who are only one of many inspirations on this audacious, immensely entertaining album. The story of St. Jimmy has an arc similar to HÃ¼sker DÃ¼'s landmark punk-opera Zen Arcade, while the music has grandiose flourishes straight out of both Queen and Rocky Horror Picture Show (the '50s pastiche \"Rock and Roll Girlfriend\" is punk rock Meat Loaf), all tied together with a nervy urgency and a political passion reminiscent of the Clash, or all the anti-Reagan American hardcore bands of the '80s. These are just the clearest touchstones for American Idiot, but reducing the album to its influences gives the inaccurate impression that this is no more than a patchwork quilt of familiar sounds, when it's an idiosyncratic, visionary work in its own right. First of all, part of Green Day's appeal is how they have personalized the sounds of the past, making time-honored guitar rock traditions seem fresh, even vital. With their first albums, they styled themselves after first-generation punk they were too young to hear firsthand, and as their career progressed, the group not only synthesized these influences into something distinctive, but chief songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong turned into a muscular, versatile songwriter in his own right. \r\nWarning illustrated their growing musical acumen quite impressively, but here, the music isn't only tougher, it's fluid and, better still, it fuels the anger, disillusionment, heartbreak, frustration, and scathing wit at the core of American Idiot. And one of the truly startling things about American Idiot is how the increased musicality of the band is matched by Armstrong's incisive, cutting lyrics, which effectively convey the paranoia and fear of living in American in days after 9/11, but also veer into moving, intimate small-scale character sketches. There's a lot to absorb here, and cynics might dismiss it after one listen as a bit of a mess when it's really a rich, multi-faceted work, one that is bracing upon the first spin and grows in stature and becomes more addictive with each repeated play. Like all great concept albums, American Idiot works on several different levels. It can be taken as a collection of great songs -- songs that are as visceral or as poignant as Green Day at their best, songs that resonate outside of the larger canvas of the story, as the fiery anti-Dubya title anthem proves -- but these songs have a different, more lasting impact when taken as a whole. While its breakneck, freewheeling musicality has many inspirations, there really aren't many records like American Idiot (bizarrely enough, the Fiery Furnaces' Blueberry Boat is one of the closest, at least on a sonic level, largely because both groups draw deeply from the kaleidoscopic \"A Quick One\"). In its musical muscle and sweeping, politically charged narrative, it's something of a masterpiece, and one of the few -- if not the only -- records of 2004 to convey what it feels like to live in the strange, bewildering America of the early 2000s. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine","index":1,"year":2004,"thumb":"/library/metadata/9669/thumb/1483221152","art":"/library/metadata/9668/art/1483969208","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/9668/thumb/1483969208","originallyAvailableAt":"2004-09-21","addedAt":1438945565,"updatedAt":1483221152,"Genre":[{"tag":"Punk Pop"},{"tag":"Punk"}]},{"ratingKey":"8434","key":"/library/metadata/8434/children","parentRatingKey":"8427","studio":"American Recordings","type":"album","title":"American IV: The Man Comes Around","parentKey":"/library/metadata/8427","parentTitle":"Johnny Cash","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":1,"lastViewedAt":1440533021,"year":2002,"thumb":"/library/metadata/8434/thumb/1483219964","art":"/library/metadata/8427/art/1483888969","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/8427/thumb/1483888969","originallyAvailableAt":"2002-11-05","addedAt":1438256772,"updatedAt":1483219964,"Genre":[{"tag":"Outlaw Country"},{"tag":"Honky Tonk & Outlaw"},{"tag":"Country & Western"}]},{"ratingKey":"8437","key":"/library/metadata/8437/children","parentRatingKey":"8427","studio":"American/Lost Highway","type":"album","title":"American V: A Hundred Highways","parentKey":"/library/metadata/8427","parentTitle":"Johnny Cash","summary":"American V: A Hundred Highways is the long-awaited album of Johnny Cash's final recordings, the basic tracks for which (i.e., Cash's vocals) were recorded in 2002-2003, with overdubs added by producer Rick Rubin after his death on September 12, 2003, at age 71. Between 1994 and 2002, Cash and Rubin had succeeded in fashioning a third act for the veteran country singer's career, following his acclaimed 1950s work for Sun Records and his popular recordings for Columbia in the 1960s and '70s. In the '80s, Cash's star had faded, but Rubin reinvented him as a hip country-folk-rock elder at 62 with American Recordings (1994), his first new studio album to reach the pop charts in 18 years. Unchained (1996) and American III: Solitary Man (2000) continued the comeback, at least as far as the critics were concerned, though none of the albums was actually a big seller. But American IV: The Man Comes Around (2002), propelled by Cash's cover of Nine Inch Nails' \"Hurt\" and a powerful video, stayed in the pop charts longer than any Cash album since 1969's Johnny Cash at San Quentin. By 2002, however, Cash was in failing health, homebound and in a wheelchair, and he suffered a personal blow when his wife, June Carter Cash, died on May 15, 2003.  The American series, which posited Cash as an aged sage and the repository for a bottomless American songbook, had already shown a predilection for gloom in the name of gravity; it's no surprise that the fifth and final volume would be even more concerned with, as three earlier Cash compilations had put it, God, Love, and Murder. The ailing septuagenarian certainly sounds like he's near the end of his life, but that said, he doesn't sound bad. Cash was never a great singer in a technical sense: he hadn't much range, his pitch often wobbled, and his lack of breath control sometimes found him grasping for sound at the end of lines. But he was a great singer in the sense of projecting a persona through his voice; his emotional range, which went from a Sinatra-like swagger to an almost embarrassingly intimate vulnerability, was as wide as the spread of notes he could hit confidently was narrow. Such a singer doesn't really lose that much with age; in fact, he gains even more interpretive depth. Listening to this album, one can't get around the knowledge that it is a posthumous collection made in Cash's last days, but even without that context, it would have much the same impact. \r\nThe album begins with two religious songs, Larry Gatlin's \"Help Me,\" a plea to God, and the traditional \"God's Gonna Cut You Down,\" which, in a sense, answers that plea. The finality of death thus established, Cash launches into what is billed as the last song he ever wrote, \"Like the 309,\" which is about a train taking his casket away. The same image is used later in the cover of Hank Williams' \"On the Evening Train,\" in which a man and his child put the coffin of a wife and mother on another train. Cash sings these songs in a restrained manner, and even has a sense of humor in \"Like the 309,\" in which he complains about his asthma: \"It should be awhile/Before I see Doctor Death/So it would sure be nice/If I could get my breath.\" In between the two train songs come songs that may not have been about death when their authors wrote them, but sure sound like they are here. As written, Gordon Lightfoot's \"If You Could Read My Mind\" seems to concern a romantic breakup expressed in literary and cinematic terms, but in Cash's voice, lines like \"You know that ghost is me\" and \"But stories always end\" become inescapably elegiac. Bruce Springsteen's \"Further On (Up the Road)\" is even easier to interpret as a call to the hereafter, with lines like \"Got on my dead man's suit and my smilin' skull ring/My lucky graveyard boots and song to sing.\" These two songs make a pair with the album's two closing songs. Ian Tyson's \"Four Strong Winds\" is, like the Lightfoot selection, a folk standard by a Canadian songwriter, also nominally about romantic dissolution, although here the singer who is \"bound for moving on\" doesn't seem likely to come back. And the closing song, \"I'm Free from the Chain Gang Now,\" may have lyrics implying that the unjustly imprisoned narrator has been set free, but in Cash's voice it sounds like he's been executed instead and is singing from beyond the grave. The four songs in between \"On the Evening Train\" and \"Four Strong Winds,\" dealing with faith and love (the former expressed in a previously recorded 1984 Cash copyright, \"I Came to Believe\"), are weaker than what surrounds them, but they serve to complete the picture. And it's worth noting that Cash at death's door still outsings croaking Rod McKuen on the songwriter's ever-cloying \"Love's Been Good to Me.\" Cash may never have heard Rubin's overdubs, but they are restrained and tasteful, never doing anything more than to support the singer and the song. If the entire series of American recordings makes for a fitting finale to a great career, American V: A Hundred Highways is a more than respectable coda. ~William Ruhlmann","index":1,"viewCount":1,"lastViewedAt":1440576244,"year":2006,"thumb":"/library/metadata/8437/thumb/1483219968","art":"/library/metadata/8427/art/1483888969","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/8427/thumb/1483888969","originallyAvailableAt":"2006-07-04","addedAt":1438256772,"updatedAt":1483219968,"Genre":[{"tag":"Outlaw Country"},{"tag":"Honky Tonk & Outlaw"},{"tag":"Country & Western"}]},{"ratingKey":"7728","key":"/library/metadata/7728/children","parentRatingKey":"7727","studio":"Unsigned","type":"album","title":"Amid the Flowers","parentKey":"/library/metadata/7727","parentTitle":"Less Is More","summary":"","index":1,"userRating":10.0,"viewCount":38,"lastViewedAt":1479464626,"year":2014,"thumb":"/library/metadata/7728/thumb/1483221971","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/7727/thumb/1483969681","originallyAvailableAt":"2014-01-01","addedAt":1458302693,"updatedAt":1483221971,"Genre":[{"tag":"Alternative"}]}]}}
