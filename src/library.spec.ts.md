          summary: 'Stereo Rodeo is Rusted Root\'s first studio album in seven years -- a long stretch of time by any measure but especially long for a group who at its heart is a working band, earning its audience by constant performances. Constant performances should lead to regular recordings, but not for Rusted Root in the new millennium, who released not a single collection of new material since the attempted pop crossover of 2002\'s Welcome to My Party. Stereo Rodeo has elements of that shiny gloss, but there\'s a heavy emphasis on their elastic worldbeat grooves which, more than ever, seem indebted to latter-day Talking Heads, only minus the esoteric egghead bent. Rusted Root still lean toward crowd-pleasing jams -- clearly evident on their slow take of Elvis\' "Suspicious Minds," but also on their lengthy groove-oriented cuts where mood supersedes hooks, something that is a bit of a Rusted Root trademark. So in that sense, Stereo Rodeo could be seen as a correction or a tacit apology for the pop inclinations of Welcome to My Party, a way to get the band back to their roots without drawing attention to any machinations that get them there. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

          summary: 'When Alex Ebert re-emerged in 2009 as messianic musical cult leader Edward Sharpe, many familiar with his previous band, Ima Robot, weren\'t buying it. With Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros, Ebert made the dramatic 180 from sleazy electroclash-leaning punk singer to grizzly bearded bandleader in an 11-piece down-home freak folk revue, bright psychedelic colors and farmhouse harmonies replacing his not too distant past of black leather and smirky sneers. Artists change constantly, and Ebert\'s reinvention wasn\'t completely laughable or phony. While mired with some cringe-inducing Jim Morrison aping and a generally cluttered sense of arrangement, the band\'s debut album, Up from Below, had some bright moments when the strength of the songwriting cut through the affectation and actually seemed genuine in a roundabout way. A few years later, Here is much the same. The bandmembers wear the whole communal free-living throwback hippie jamboree persona to the point where they dip into goofy character sketches and threaten to detract completely from some pretty catchy songs. The album opens strongly, with the undeniably catchy pair of tunes "Man on Fire" and "That\'s What\'s Up," both rising to handclapping summits of old-fashioned Southern revival and jug band jubilation. The hooky choruses are solid, but there\'s a pretty heavy sense of musical theater throughout these highlights, leaving the Magnetic Zeros coming off more like Jesus Christ Superstar meets Emit Otter\'s Jug Band Christmas than the freak folk hoedown they were aiming for. Lead vocalist Jade Castrinos reprises her role trading verses with Ebert on these songs and later takes center stage on the electrified "Fiya Wata." Castrinos\' contributions feel spirited and from the gut, whether they\'re put on or not. Following a strong start, the album fades into a series of exercises in style or emulation. Washy group vocal slow-burner "Mayla" is an acid-soaked sunshine daydream of little substance complete with Jerry Garcia-styled guitar noodling throughout. "One Love to Another" is a striking exhibit of a Bob Marley ripoff, a daring move in even the most fried acid rock circles. While the string of affectations and re-creations of various sects of hippie culture aren\'t completely unenjoyable, they get old really fast, especially on the weaker material. Ebert\'s intentions and previous bands are really immaterial in the case of Here. The album comes up short in the song department and doesn\'t quite get by on its abundance of free-love signifiers. [Here was also released on LP.] ~ Fred Thomas',

          summary: 'Nothing truly prepares anyone for the loss of a parent. No matter how aware one may be about the realities of disease and death, no matter what their attitude about their mother or father, experiencing the passing of the person who brought them into this world hits hard and deep, and the survivors are left to come to terms with their pain in their own ways. Sufjan Stevens is a songwriter and a musician, so it should come as no surprise that in the wake of the death of his mother Carrie in 2012, his grief took the form of a collection of songs. But 2015\'s Carrie & Lowell is not a simple homage to Stevens\' mother and stepfather. Stevens had a difficult relationship with his mother that would defy a simple farewell; she left his father when Stevens was just a year old, and she was a random presence throughout much of his childhood. While there\'s deep and genuine love in Carrie & Lowell, there\'s also uncertainty, sadness, and brief but jagged bursts of anger; these songs speak of loss and heartache and the difficult push and pull of familial relationships, but they\'re also full of random memories, both pleasant and troubling, and they leap from reveries of family vacations faded by the passing of decades, to the immediate regrets of what was or wasn\'t said and done in the aftermath of death. Carrie & Lowell is about memory as much as mourning, and Stevens has drawn these songs in a purposefully elegant manner, with his introspection accompanied by beautiful but homespun melodies, and the arrangements and production only magnifying their dreamlike, whisper-quiet drift that strikes with an emotional force that a louder, more violent approach could not achieve. Carrie & Lowell is a heartfelt expression of love that is devoid of the slightest hint of sentimentality, and with these songs, Stevens strips his emotions bare and allows us all to be the audience for his anger, shame, and sense of loss as he pages through his memories of his family. Carrie & Lowell is the most harrowingly personal work Stevens has offered us to date; it also ranks with his most skillfully crafted albums despite its spartan approach, and it\'s a sometimes difficult but profoundly moving work. Stevens has offered us some fine albums in the past, but he\'s never made anything quite like Carrie & Lowell. ~ Mark Deming',

          summary: 'Guitarist Ryley Walker follows All Kinds of You, his 2014 debut full-length, by delving deeper into some of the abstract jazz and psych-inflected folk-rock that permeated several of its tracks. On Primrose Green -- his debut for Dead Oceans -- he doesn\'t worry about putting his own signature on his tunes; this record is all about playing music he loves with people he respects. Though these are original songs, their inspirational roots lie in late-\'60s and early-\'70s sources. He\'s found a host of willing Chicago collaborators from the worlds of jazz and improv to assist, including cellists Fred Lonberg-Holm and Whitney Johnson, vibraphonist Jason Adasiewicz, drummer Frank Rosaly, keyboardist Ben Boye, upright and electric bassist Anton Hatwich, and electric guitarist Brian Sulpizio. Less than a minute into the opening title track, one can hear the very spirit of Tim Buckley -- one of several Walker muses here -- coming through the ether (or smoke, such as it were, since it is titled for a particular strain of pot). Eastern modes and droning psych are rung out on a 12-string, piano, electric guitars, vibes, and upright bass (the latter recalling Danny Thompson, who played with Buckley on the London concert issued as Dream Letter). Walker\'s voice swoops and sails, floats and hovers through his words about getting high. "Summer Dress" moves on (a bit) to widen the circle and embrace John Martyn\'s early-\'70s sound inside Buckley\'s elastic chamber jazz approach. Sulpizio\'s guitar and Adasiewicz\'s vibes send this one into a darkly grooving stratosphere. "Same Minds" is so silvery and mercurial, one can feel Martyn\'s ghost in the mix. The instrumental "Love Can Be Cruel" evokes Brian Auger\'s sense of space and motion with wafting electronic noise grounding the tune in the 21st century. Speaking of Auger, the twilit psych-jazz of "Sweet Satisfaction" recalls the keyboardist\'s Trinity band with singer Julie Driscoll (now Tippetts), though Buckley\'s sense of elongated glossolalia still holds sway over the singer\'s vocal. Walker\'s killer fingerstyle guitar artistry isn\'t left off this record; it\'s present to stellar effect on "Griffiths Bucks Blues," "On the Banks of the Old Kishwaukee," "The High Road" (a duet with Lonberg-Holm), and the closing "Hide in the Roses." The latter track is informed by Bert Jansch\'s and Davy Graham\'s readings of the British Isles folk tradition. It\'s these rootsier tunes that add glue to the sensual, stoned, free-spirited cuts to make this a cohesive album. With its ready absorption of, homage to, and engagement with the past, Walker\'s skills as a guitarist and arranger make Primrose Green as musically compelling as it is willfully indulgent. ~ Thom Jurek',

          summary: 'The artificial synth-horn tones and repurposed Prince beat that begin "Shapeless," the first song on Nashville-via-Brooklyn band Wild Cub\'s debut album Youth, would seem to set the tone for an album of updated \'80s synth pop viewed through an indie lens. This is at least partially true, as there\'s an \'80s reference point on almost each of this lengthy album\'s 15 tracks. Principle singer/songwriter Keegan DeWitt\'s vocals draw on Peter Gabriel, Bowie, and even some Achtung Baby-era Bono-isms on the swimmy downer ballad "Drive." New Order-seeped guitar melodies, John Hughes soundtrack nostalgia, and bouncy retro-electro rhythms also funnel into the heavy \'80s influence, but apart from these familiar elements, DeWitt and his multi-instrumentalist partner Jeremy Bullock manage to take each track into unexpected places without losing the overall thread. Individually, every song seems to be exploring a wildly different territory than the others, evidenced in the disparity between the cheesy guitar noodling and Phil Collins reimagining of "Hidden in the Night" and the bounding, feel-good clarity of songs like "Windows," "Wild Light," or the shamelessly romantic and endlessly catchy "Thunder Clap." Similarly "Straight No Turns" is built around a dancy beat so hypnotic it almost becomes a club track on its extended fade-out, but blurs into almost ambient dreaminess a few songs later on the decidedly more organic tune "The Water." While each song seems to be trying on dramatically different ideas and styles, they all gel when taken as a whole. DeWitt\'s melodies seem to cycle and repeat throughout the album, giving cohesion to the songs as they amble between direct pop hooks and aimless experimenting. Themes of burning, youthful love and its uncontrollable urgency come through louder than any production choice on Youth. Similar to the cloudy nostalgia of M83 or the melodramatic yet heartfelt howling of the Arcade Fire at their most sincere, Wild Cub taps into a specific emotional thread and rides it throughout every single song here. While certain songs definitely stand on their own, the ability to capture a feeling throughout is what makes the album memorable and worthy of repeat listening. ~ Fred Thomas',

          summary: 'There has rarely been a shortage of musical talent emerging from Iceland, an island that is cast away in the northern echelons of the Atlantic Ocean, but which is rich in cultural and artistic talents, with the likes of Björk and Sigur Rós dominating their respective genres across the world. Icelandic tastemakers have also hoisted Ásgeir Trausti\'s debut album to the number one spot in the charts, a record which additionally scooped top accolades in the 2012 Icelandic Music Awards. Originally released as Dýrð í Dauðaþögn in his homeland, Ásgeir enlisted the help of John Grant to translate the record into English for this international release, and renamed it In the Silence. The melodic indie folk that Ásgeir incorporates here is poised intriguingly between acoustic instruments and electronic elements, and single the "King and Cross" expertly brings the two together in a charming slice of indie pop. The decision to translate the lyrics was wise and subsequently offers a more wide-spread accessibility to his songs that might not have been possible in his native tongue. Ásgeir and Grant have woven together whimsical tales and stories from the original Icelandic text without many obvious adjustments from the original melodies. Although upbeat for the most part -- "Torrent" and "In Harmony" are particular highlights -- there is a constant hint of melancholy that resides in the beauty of Ásgeir\'s high-pitched and unnervingly emotive vocals, which is brought out in the more brooding moments of the record. The downbeat and bass-driven "Going Home" uncovers an expansive and pensive side of Ásgeir, which is a welcome contrast to the initial sweetness, and at times tweeness, of his melodies and harmonies. Although it\'s unlikely In the Silence will have quite the same impact on the charts beyond the shores of Iceland, it does suggest another musical gem has been unearthed from the island\'s formidable pool of talent. ~ Scott Kerr',

          summary: 'Brandon Flowers\' solo debut, 2010\'s Flamingo, seemed to make the case that the line between a Killers album and a Flowers album was blurry at best. Largely a continuation of the anthemic Springsteen-influenced sound of the Killers\' 2006 effort Sam\'s Town, Flamingo also revealed Flowers\' inclination toward glossy, synth-heavy, \'80s adult-contemporary productions. For his sophomore solo outing, 2015\'s The Desired Effect, the line between the man and his band begins to sharpen. Produced by Ariel Rechtshaid (Madonna, Vampire Weekend, HAIM), the album finally finds Flowers achieving an unmistakable sound of his own, with the kind of effortless sophistication that a seasoned musician hopes for. Flowers long ago expanded his musical palette from the Killers\' early, Duran Duran-influenced brand of dance-rock, but he\'s also become much more adept at combining his disparate musical influences and poetic narratives into a cohesive, emotionally resonant approach to expansive pop songwriting. As always, these are catchy, synth heavy songs punctuated by twangy guitar lines and Flowers\' trademark lyrical themes, including: emotional turning points in long term relationships, lost souls seeking redemption, and of course, his childhood growing up in Vegas—which is particularly evident on the fittingly titled "Way It\'s Always Been." He sings, "They shut down the Golden Sahara Hotel/ Jessica says it won\'t be long til they blow it all to hell/ She\'s standing in the front yard, cut-offs and skin/ Me and her brother we been friends, since I can\'t remember when/ Ain\'t that the way that it\'s always been?/ Everybody sitting \'round waiting for the son to come again." Elsewhere, Flowers launches into an \'80s take on Spector-style wall-of-synth-sound on "Dreams Come True," and mashes up John Fogerty, ELO and Dire Straits on the Roy Orbison-style rock & roll number "Digging Up the Heart." The genius thing about all this is that Flowers doesn\'t steal Jeff Lynne\'s hooks or ape Mark Knopfler\'s guitar sound (well, not exactly), he just imbues his productions with a distinct level of tangible homage. In fact, he\'s so specific in his aural fixations that you can almost pick out the songs he was listening to when working on a given track. On "Can\'t Deny My Love," you can almost picture him starting out with the Latin synth-percussion from Madonna\'s "La Isla Bonita," then bringing in the brittle guitar of Bryan Ferry\'s "Don\'t Stop the Dance," before finally punching up the transitions with the percussive synth beats from Neneh Cherry\'s "Buffalo Stance." And this isn\'t meant to make Flowers sound derivative. On the contrary, these points of inspiration exist in a sea of original material. Flowers even brings on board a handful of special guests, like Pet Shop Boys\' Neil Tennant, on the Giorgio Moroder-esque disco tune "I Can Change," and Bruce Hornsby on the earnest ballad "Between Me and You." These choices work to underline the stylistic touchstones on the album. They also undercut any accusations of derivativeness by openly acknowledging his progenitors. And in the end, we\'re lucky he was so inspired by them, if the result is an album this solid. ~ Matt Collar',

          summary: 'Perhaps the success of "Float On" discombobulated Isaac Brock even more than we suspected. Surely, there were signs of aimlessness on We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank, the 2007 sequel to the surprise 2004 smash Good News for People Who Love Bad News, a record where hired gun Johnny Marr was brought aboard to give the band a jolt. This booster shot wore off quickly and Brock receded from the spotlight, sitting out the better part of a decade before re-emerging with Strangers to Ourselves in the spring of 2015. In the interim, he shed longterm collaborator Eric Judy -- he left sometime around 2012, replaced by Russell Higbee -- added guitarist Jim Fairchild and auxiliary player Lisa Molinaro, attempted to record an album with Big Boi, toyed with bringing Krist Novoselic aboard, then finally decided to get back to where he once belonged. Brock\'s return to roots is naturally a roundabout of detours, a record that bounces between stylized eccentricity and streamlined strangeness, stopping occasionally to soak in a scenic, dreamy view. Strangers to Ourselves starts at this hazy point, swooning with a narcotic sway that recalls peak Mercury Rev, but it\'s not long before Modest Mouse begins bouncing at a syncopation that recalls "Float On," just one of many deliberate references to the ghosts of alt-rock past haunting Strangers to Ourselves. "Pistol" skeeves out like a disco-fied outtake from Ween\'s Pure Guava, the carnivalesque "Sugar Boats" lurches forward on a circus piano reminiscent of Blur, "The Best Room" circles around a guitar riff that echoes Space Ghost Coast to Coast, each a signal that Brock is comfortable keeping the dream of the \'90s. The trick is, he now has the skill of a consummate craftsman, so the raggedness here comes across as deliberate, probably because the moments that are less consciously quirky -- i.e., the bulk of the album -- are so skillfully constructed. So, Strangers to Ourselves is an album where the trees matter more than the forest: song for song, it demonstrates the exacting nature of Brock but put it all together, it sprawls. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

          summary: 'Compared to Jamie xx\'s impact on music, it\'s easy to forget that he hasn\'t released much on his own. The distinctive yet surprisingly versatile blend of indie, R&B, and dance in his work with the xx, Gil Scott-Heron, and his remixes helped shape the sound of the late 2000s and 2010s, but his solo discography was limited to a handful of singles, many of which appear on his first full-length, In Colour. While one of his best singles, "All Under One Roof Raving," doesn\'t appear on the album, its balance of the kinetic and the atmospheric -- as well as its reverence for classic U.K. dance music -- is reflected on some of In Colour\'s brightest highlights. "Gosh" is hard-edged yet radiant, its juddering drum\'n\'bass rhythms and shouted samples adding heft and movement before swelling synths overtake the track like a sunrise after a long night out. Indeed, for most of the album, Jamie xx uses his considerable gifts for atmosphere to make listeners remember the euphoria of dance music rather than immerse them in it. Despite its brassy flourishes, "Girl"\'s filtered house is haunting and aloof instead of driving, while its former B-side "Sleep Sound" fades in and out like a dream. Given his skills as a collaborator, it\'s not surprising that some of In Colour\'s best moments occur when he shares the spotlight. While his reunion with xx bandmate Oliver Sim on the implosive "Stranger in a Room" is almost too reminiscent of their previous work, Romy Madley Croft remains one of his most inspiring muses. She gives In Colour\'s nostalgia more humanity on the beautifully blurred "Seesaw" and "Loud Places," where a sample of Idris Muhammad\'s joyous "Could Heaven Ever Be Like This" makes the contrast between then and now, and alone and together, all the more poignant. However, the album\'s most immediate moment belongs to Young Thug and Popcaan. Inspired by a drive from Manhattan to Brooklyn while listening to Hot 97, the summery "I Know There\'s Gonna Be (Good Times)" embraces pop, hip-hop, and dancehall in a way that feels evocative and forward-looking. As it moves from reflective to engaging and back again, In Colour covers the entire spectrum of Jamie xx\'s music, delivering flashes of brilliance along the way. [In Colour was also released on LP.] ~ Heather Phares',

          summary: 'To call OutKast\'s follow-up to their 2000 masterpiece Stankonia the most eagerly awaited hip-hop album of the new millennium may be hyperbole, but not by much. In its kaleidoscopic, deep-fried amalgam of Dirty South, dirty funk, techno, and psychedelia, Stankonia was fearlessly exploratory and giddy with possibilities. It was hard to imagine where the duo was going to go next, but one possibility that few entertained was that Big Boi and Andre 3000 would split apart, each recording an album on his own and then releasing the pair as the fifth OutKast album, Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, in the fall of 2003. Although both albums have their own distinct character, the effect is kind of like if the Beatles issued The White Album as one LP of Lennon tunes, the other of McCartney songs -- the individual records may be more coherent, but the illusion that the group can do anything is tarnished. By isolating themselves from each other, Big Boi and Andre 3000 diminish the idea of OutKast slightly, since the focus is on the individuals, not the group. Which, of course, is part of the point of releasing solo albums under the group name -- it\'s to prove that the two can exist under the umbrella of the OutKast aesthetic while standing as individuals. Thing is, while it would have been a wild, bracing listen to hear these 39 songs mixed up, alternating between Boi and Dre cuts, the two albums do prove that the music can be solo in execution but remain OutKast records through and through. Both records are visionary, imaginative listens, providing some of the best music of 2003, regardless of genre. If conventional wisdom, based on their public personas and previous music, held that Big Boi\'s record, Speakerboxxx, would be the more conventional of the two and Andre 3000\'s The Love Below the more experimental, that doesn\'t turn out to be quite true. From the moment Speakerboxxx kicks into gear with "GhettoMusick" and its relentless blend of old-school 808s and breakneck breakbeats, it\'s clear that Boi is ignoring boundaries, and the rest of his album follows suit. It\'s grounded firmly within hip-hop, but the beats bend against the grain and the arrangements are overflowing with ideas and thrilling, unpredictable juxtapositions, such as how "Bowtie" swings like big-band jazz filtered through George Clinton, how "The Way You Move" offsets its hard-driving verses with seductive choruses, or how "The Rooster" cheerfully rides a threatening minor-key mariachi groove, salted by slippery horns and loose-limbed wah-wah guitars. It\'s a hell of a ride, reclaiming the adventurous spirit of the golden age and pushing it into a new era.  By contrast, The Love Below isn\'t so much visionary as it is unapologetically eccentric. And as the cocktail jazz pianos that sparkle through the first few songs indicate, it\'s not much of a hip-hop album. Instead, Andre 3000 has created the great lost Prince album -- the platter that the Purple One recorded somewhere between Around the World in a Day and Sign \'o\' the Times. It\'s not just that the music and song titles cheekily recall Prince -- "She Lives in My Lap" is a close relation of the B-side "She\'s Always in My Hair" -- it\'s that Dre disregards any rules on a quest to create his own interior world, right down to a dialogue with God. The difference between Andre 3000 and Prince is in that dialogue, too: Prince was tortured; Andre is trying to get laid. That cheerfully randy spirit surges through The Love Below, even on the spooky-serious closer, "A Life in the Day of Benjamin Andre," and it gives Andre the freedom to try a little of everything, from mock crooning on "Love Haters" to a breakbeat jazz interpretation of "My Favorite Things" to the strange one-man funk of "Roses" and the incandescent "Hey Ya!," where classic soul and electro-funk coexist happily. So, both records are very different, but the remarkable thing is, they both feel thoroughly like OutKast music. Big Boi and Andre 3000 took off in different directions from the same starting point, yet they wind up sounding unified because they share the same freewheeling aesthetic, where everything is alive and everything is possible within their music. That spirit fuels not just the best hip-hop, but the best pop music, and both Speakerboxxx and The Love Below are among the best hip-hop and best pop music released this decade. Each is a knockout individually, and paired together, their force is undeniable. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

          summary: 'George Evelyn\'s solo step as Nightmares on Wax, Smokers Delight, is a whole delightfully irreducible to its parts, which, as with earlier releases, is largely electro, hip-hop, and soul, with bits of Latin percussion and down-tempo funk thrown in. The album spawned a pair of somewhat forgettable remix EPs and was reissued by TVT immediately upon release. ~ Sean Cooper',

Once again working with executive producer Alex Da Kid (Imagine Dragons, Nicki Minaj, Eminem), VHS follows up the group\'s previous Alex Da Kid-produced EPs, including 2013\'s Love Songs Drug Songs and 2014\'s The Reason. As with those releases, VHS showcases the talents of lead singer/songwriter Sam Harris, keyboardist Casey Harris, and guitarist Noah Feldsuh. Featured on VHS are several guest collaborations, including the previously released "Jungle" with Jamie N Commons and "Fear" with Imagine Dragons. Also included on VHS is the hit single "Renegades." ~ Matt Collar',

          summary: 'James Taylor never sets his guitar down -- he spends a good portion of every year satisfying faithful audiences -- but he did rest his pen, opting to sit out the 13 years following the release of 2002\'s October Road. He kept busy with covers albums and Christmas records, but Before This World finds Taylor returning to writing, a habit he abandoned about a decade prior. Often, Before This World contains echoes of the first decade of the new millennium -- there is a passing reference to 9/11 in a song about Afghanistan and a love letter to the Boston Red Sox\'s 2004 World Series win -- but Taylor wrote these all in a batch, then recorded them at home with his touring band. Such quick progress gives the record a cozy, unified feeling but, unlike some latter-day JT records, it\'s not too comfortable. Taylor is randy enough to sing about some "first-class poontang" on the nicely grooving "Stretch of the Highway," a song more notable for a mellow vamp worthy of Steely Dan, the first suggestion there\'s a bit more variety here than on a typical Taylor platter. He\'ll ease into his trademark laid-back pop, opening the proceedings with "Today Today Today" and brightening up the midsection with the happy "Watchin\' Over Me," but as the record comes toward its conclusion, he takes detours into traditional English folk on "Before This World/Jolly Springtime" and "Wild Mountain Thyme," while etching out a cinematic protest song in "Far Afghanistan." When a record runs only ten tracks and 41 minutes, these departures amount to nearly half the record and turn Before This World into something unexpected: a record as relaxed as the average James Taylor album but one that\'s also riskier and richer, the right album for him to make at this date.

          summary: 'James Taylor had scored eight Top 40 hits by the fall of 1976 when Warner Brothers marked the end of his contract with this compilation. One of those hits, the Top Ten gold single "Mockingbird," a duet with his wife Carly Simon, was on Elektra Records, part of the Warner family of labels and presumably available, but it was left off. "Long Ago and Far Away," a lesser hit (though it made the Top Ten on the easy listening charts), wasn\'t used either. In addition to the six hits -- "Fire and Rain," "Country Road," "You\'ve Got a Friend," "Don\'t Let Me Be Lonely Tonight," "How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)," and "Shower the People" -- that were included, the album featured a couple of less successful singles, "Mexico" and "Walking Man," the album track "Sweet Baby James," and three previously unreleased recordings -- a live version of "Steamroller" and newly recorded versions of "Something in the Way She Moves" and "Carolina in My Mind," songs featured on Taylor\'s 1968 debut album, recorded for Apple/Capitol. The result was a reasonable collection for an artist who wasn\'t particularly well-defined by his singles. One got little sense of Taylor\'s evolution from the dour, confessional songs of his first two albums to the more conventional pop songs of his sixth and seventh ones. But one did hear isolated examples of Taylor\'s undeniable warmth and facility for folk/country-tinged pop. By the next summer, Taylor was back in the Top Ten on Columbia, and Greatest Hits was out of date. But it remains a good sampler of Taylor\'s more popular early work.

          summary: 'Al Stewart had found his voice on Past, Present & Future and found his sound on Modern Times. He then perfected it all on 1976\'s Year of the Cat, arguably his masterpiece. There is no overarching theme here, as there was on its two immediate predecessors, but the impossible lushness of Alan Parsons\' production and Stewart\'s evocative Continental narratives give the record a welcome feeling of cohesion that keeps the record enchanting as it moves from "Lord Grenville" to "Midas Shadow" to "Broadway Hotel," before it ends with the haunting title track. Along the way, Stewart doesn\'t dwell too deeply in any area, preferring to trace out mysteries with his evocative lyrical imagery and a spinning array of self-consciously sophisticated music, songs that evoke American and European folk and pop with a deliberate grace. This could be unbearably precious if it didn\'t work so well. Stewart is detached from his music, but only in the sense that he gives this album a stylish elegance, and Parsons is his perfect foil, giving the music a rich, panoramic sweep that mimics Stewart\'s globe-trotting songs. The result is a tremendous example of how good self-conscious progressive pop can be, given the right producer and songwriter -- and if you\'re a fan of either prog or pop and haven\'t given Al Stewart much thought, prepare to be enchanted. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

          summary: 'Weighing in at 15 CDs, The Studio Albums 1969-1983 is a hefty box set but, at $85, it is relatively affordable considering that it contains everything Alice Cooper -- both the band and the man -- recorded at Straight and Warner. Whatever bonus material attached to CD reissues over the years has been stripped away -- nothing from the 2001 deluxe edition of Billion Dollar Babies, then -- and there are no new remasters of the albums, but this set isn\'t bare bones. The mini-LP replicas contain a few inserts carried over from the vinyl and, more importantly, those early Straight Records are present, which is good because they were out of print for a while. Not everything here is great  -- he did have a rough patch in the late \'70s and early \'80s -- but it\'s all interesting, and it\'s especially nice to be able to get the entire catalog so easily and cheaply. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

          summary: 'The Cars\' 1978 self-titled debut, issued on the Elektra label, is a genuine rock masterpiece. The band jokingly referred to the album as their "true greatest-hits album," but it\'s no exaggeration -- all nine tracks are new wave/rock classics, still in rotation on rock radio. Whereas most bands of the late \'70s embraced either punk/new wave or hard rock, the Cars were one of the first bands to do the unthinkable -- merge the two styles together. Add to it bandleader/songwriter Ric Ocasek\'s supreme pop sensibilities, and you had an album that appealed to new wavers, rockers, and Top 40 fans. One of the most popular new wave songs ever, "Just What I Needed," is an obvious highlight, as are such familiar hits as "Good Times Roll," "My Best Friend\'s Girl," and "You\'re All I\'ve Got Tonight." But like most consummate rock albums, the lesser-known compositions are just as exhilarating: "Don\'t Cha Stop," "Bye Bye Love," "All Mixed Up," and "Moving in Stereo," the latter featured as an instrumental during a steamy scene in the popular movie Fast Times at Ridgemont High. With flawless performances, songwriting, and production (courtesy of Queen alumni Roy Thomas Baker), the Cars\' debut remains one of rock\'s all-time classics.

          summary: 'The Doobie Brothers\' third long-player was the charm, their most substantial and consistent album to date, and one that rode the charts for a year. It was also a study in contrasts, Tom Johnston\'s harder-edged, bolder rocking numbers balanced by Patrick Simmons\' more laid-back country-rock ballad style. The leadoff track, Johnston\'s "Natural Thing," melded the two, opening with interlocking guitars and showcasing the band\'s exquisite soaring harmonies around a beautiful melody, all wrapped up in a midtempo beat -- the result was somewhere midway between Allman Brothers-style virtuosity and Eagles/Crosby & Nash-type lyricism, which defined this period in the Doobies\' history and gave them a well-deserved lock on the top of the charts. Next up was the punchy, catchy "Long Train Runnin\'," a piece they\'d been playing for years as an instrumental -- a reluctant Johnston was persuaded by producer Ted Templeman to write lyrics to it and record the song, and the resulting track became the group\'s next hit. The slashing, fast-tempo "China Grove" and "Without You" represented the harder side of the Doobies\' sound, and were juxtaposed with Simmons\' romantic country-rock ballads "Clear as the Driven Snow," and "South City Midnight Lady." Simmons also showed off his louder side with "Evil Woman," while Johnston showed his more reflective side with "Dark Eyed Cajun Woman," "Ukiah" and "The Captain and Me" -- the latter, a soaring rocker clocking in at nearly five minutes, features radiant guitars and harmonies, soaring ever higher and faster to a triumphant finish. ~ Bruce Eder',

          summary: 'Following on the heels of an album where he repudiated his past with his greatest backing band, Blood on the Tracks finds Bob Dylan, in a way, retreating to the past, recording a largely quiet, acoustic-based album. But this is hardly nostalgia -- this is the sound of an artist returning to his strengths, what feels most familiar, as he accepts a traumatic situation, namely the breakdown of his marriage. This is an album alternately bitter, sorrowful, regretful, and peaceful, easily the closest he ever came to wearing his emotions on his sleeve. That\'s not to say that it\'s an explicitly confessional record, since many songs are riddles or allegories, yet the warmth of the music makes it feel that way. The original version of the album was even quieter -- first takes of "Idiot Wind" and "Tangled Up in Blue," available on The Bootleg Series, Vols. 1-3, are hushed and quiet (excised verses are quoted in the liner notes, but not heard on the record) -- but Blood on the Tracks remains an intimate, revealing affair since these harsher takes let his anger surface the way his sadness does elsewhere. As such, it\'s an affecting, unbearably poignant record, not because it\'s a glimpse into his soul, but because the songs are remarkably clear-eyed and sentimental, lovely and melancholy at once. And, in a way, it\'s best that he was backed with studio musicians here, since the professional, understated backing lets the songs and emotion stand at the forefront. Dylan made albums more influential than this, but he never made one better. [In 2003, Columbia/Legacy reissued 15 selected titles from Dylan\'s catalog as hybrid SACDs, playable in both regular CD players and Super Audio CD players. Each title is packaged as a digipak, containing the full original artwork. On each of the titles, and on each of the layers, the remastered sound is spectacular, a considerable upgrade from the initial CD pressings. Blood on the Tracks was one of five titles that also included a 5.1 Surround Sound mix.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

          summary: 'Peter Gabriel introduced his fifth studio album, So, with "Sledgehammer," an Otis Redding-inspired soul-pop raver that was easily his catchiest, happiest single to date. Needless to say, it was also his most accessible, and, in that sense it was a good introduction to So, the catchiest, happiest record he ever cut. "Sledgehammer" propelled the record toward blockbuster status, and Gabriel had enough songs with single potential to keep it there. There was "Big Time," another colorful dance number; "Don\'t Give Up," a moving duet with Kate Bush; "Red Rain," a stately anthem popular on album rock radio; and "In Your Eyes," Gabriel\'s greatest love song, which achieved genuine classic status after being featured in Cameron Crowe\'s classic Say Anything. These all illustrated the strengths of the album: Gabriel\'s increased melodicism and ability to blend African music, jangly pop, and soul into his moody art rock. Apart from these singles, plus the urgent "That Voice Again," the rest of the record is as quiet as the album tracks of Security. The difference is, the singles on that record were part of the overall fabric; here, the singles are the fabric, which can make the album seem top-heavy (a fault of many blockbuster albums, particularly those of the mid-\'80s). Even so, those songs are so strong, finding Gabriel in a newfound confidence and accessibility, that it\'s hard not to be won over by them, even if So doesn\'t develop the unity of its two predecessors.

          summary: `The leap from 1970's Benefit to the following year's Aqualung is one of the most astonishing progressions in rock history. In the space of one album, Tull went from relatively unassuming electrified folk-rock to larger-than-life conceptual rock full of sophisticated compositions and complex, intellectual, lyrical constructs. While the leap to full-blown prog rock wouldn't be taken until a year later on Thick as a Brick, the degree to which Tull upped the ante here is remarkable.␍␊
          The lyrical concept -- the hypocrisy of Christianity in England -- is stronger than on most other '70s conceptual efforts, but it's ultimately the music that makes it worthy of praise. Tull's winning way with a riff was never so arresting as on the chugging "Locomotive Breath," or on the character studies "Cross Eyed Mary" and "Aqualung," which portray believably seedy participants in Ian Anderson's story. The fable imagery of "Mother Goose" and the vitriolic anti-authoritarian sentiments of "Wind Up" both serve notice of Anderson's willful iconoclasm and his disillusionment with the spiritual traditions to which he was born. Varied but cohesive, Aqualung is widely regarded as Tull's finest hour. [Aqualung was released in a two-CD/two-DVD box set in 2016.] ~ Rovi Staff`,

          summary: 'Jethro Tull\'s first LP-length epic is a masterpiece in the annals of progressive rock, and one of the few works of its kind that still holds up decades later. Mixing hard rock and English folk music with classical influences, set to stream-of-consciousness lyrics so dense with imagery that one might spend weeks pondering their meaning -- assuming one feels the need to do so -- the group created a dazzling tour de force, at once playful, profound, and challenging, without overwhelming the listener. The original LP was the best-sounding, best-engineered record Tull had ever released, easily capturing the shifting dynamics between the soft all-acoustic passages and the electric rock crescendos surrounding them. ~ Bruce Eder',

          summary: 'War Child was Jethro Tull\'s first album after two chart-toppers, Thick as a Brick and A Passion Play, and was one of those records that was a hit the day it was announced (it was certified platinum based on pre-orders, the last Tull album to earn platinum record status). It never made the impression of its predecessors, however, as it was a return to standard-length songs following two epic-length pieces. It was inevitable that the material would lack power, if only because the opportunity for development that gave Thick as a Brick and A Passion Play some of their power. Additionally, the music was no longer quite able to cover for the obscurity of Tull\'s lyrics ("Two Fingers" being the best example). The title track is reasonably successful, but "Queen and Country" seems repetitive and pointless. "Ladies," by contrast, is one of Tull\'s folk-based pieces, and one of the prettiest songs on the record, beautifully sung and benefiting from some of Anderson\'s best flute playing to date. The band is very tight but doesn\'t really get to show its stuff until "Back-Door Angels," after which the album picks up. "Sealion" is one of Anderson\'s pseudo-philosophical musings on life, mixing full-out electric playing and restrained orchestral backing in a manner that recalls Thick as a Brick. "Skating Away on the Thin Ice of a New Day" is a beautiful, largely acoustic number that was popular in concert, but "Bungle in the Jungle," with a title that went over well, got most of the radio play. "The Third Hoorah" is really a follow-up to "War Child," and opens with one of the prettiest progressions on a folk tune in Tull\'s repertory, with some lovely harpsichord from John Evan evolving into a powerful rock number with a surprising orchestral break and what has to be the most successful appearance of bagpipes in a mainstream rock song.

          summary: 'Billy Joel teamed with Phil Ramone, a famed engineer who had just scored his first producing hits with Art Garfunkel\'s Breakaway and Paul Simon\'s Still Crazy After All These Years for The Stranger, his follow-up to Turnstiles. Joel still favored big, sweeping melodies, but Ramone convinced him to streamline his arrangements and clean up the production. The results aren\'t necessarily revelatory, since he covered so much ground on Turnstiles, but the commercialism of The Stranger is a bit of a surprise. None of his ballads have been as sweet or slick as "Just the Way You Are"; he never had created a rocker as bouncy or infectious as "Only the Good Die Young"; and the glossy production of "She\'s Always a Woman" disguises its latent misogynist streak. Joel balanced such radio-ready material with a series of New York vignettes, seemingly inspired by Springsteen\'s working-class fables and clearly intended to be the artistic centerpieces of the album. They do provide The Stranger with the feel of a concept album, yet there is no true thematic connection between the pieces, and his lyrics are often vague or mean-spirited. His lyrical shortcomings are overshadowed by his musical strengths. Even if his melodies sound more Broadway than Beatles -- the epic suite "Scenes From an Italian Restaurant" feels like a show-stopping closer -- there\'s no denying that the melodies of each song on The Stranger are memorable, so much so that they strengthen the weaker portions of the album. Joel rarely wrote a set of songs better than those on The Stranger, nor did he often deliver an album as consistently listenable. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

          summary: 'It was designed to be a blockbuster and it was. Prior to Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Elton John had hits -- his second album, Elton John, went Top 10 in the U.S. and U.K., and he had smash singles in "Crocodile Rock" and "Daniel" -- but this 1973 album was a statement of purpose spilling over two LPs, which was all the better to showcase every element of John\'s spangled personality. Opening with the 11-minute melodramatic exercise "Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding" -- as prog as Elton ever got -- Goodbye Yellow Brick Road immediately embraces excess but also tunefulness, as John immediately switches over to "Candle in the Wind" and "Bennie & the Jets," two songs that form the core of his canon and go a long way toward explaining the over-stuffed appeal of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. This was truly the debut of Elton John the entertainer, the pro who knows how to satisfy every segment of his audience, and this eagerness to please means the record is giddy but also overwhelming, a rush of too much muchness. Still, taken a side at a time, or even a song a time, it is a thing of wonder, serving up such perfectly sculpted pop songs as "Grey Seal," full-bore rockers as "Saturday Night\'s Alright for Fighting" and "Your Sister Can\'t Twist (But She Can Rock & Roll)," cinematic ballads like "I\'ve Seen That Movie Too," throwbacks to the dusty conceptual sweep of Tumbleweed Connection in the form of "The Ballad of Danny Bailey (1909-34)," and preposterous glam novelties, like "Jamaica Jerk-Off." This touched on everything John did before, and suggested ways he\'d move in the near-future, and that sprawl is always messy but usually delightful, a testament to Elton\'s \'70s power as a star and a musician. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

          summary: 'There is no other album like Bat Out of Hell, unless you want to count the sequel. This is Grand Guignol pop -- epic, gothic, operatic, and silly, and it\'s appealing because of all of this. Jim Steinman was a composer without peer, simply because nobody else wanted to make mini-epics like this. And there never could have been a singer more suited for his compositions than Meat Loaf, a singer partial to bombast, albeit shaded bombast. The compositions are staggeringly ridiculous, yet Meat Loaf finds the emotional core in each song, bringing true heartbreak to "Two out of Three Ain\'t Bad" and sly humor to "Paradise by the Dashboard Light." There\'s no discounting the production of Todd Rundgren, either, who gives Steinman\'s self-styled grandiosity a production that\'s staggeringly big but never overwhelming and always alluring. While the sentiments are deliberately adolescent and filled with jokes and exaggerated clichés, there\'s real (albeit silly) wit behind these compositions, not just in the lyrics but in the music, which is a savvy blend of oldies pastiche, show tunes, prog rock, Springsteen-esque narratives, and blistering hard rock (thereby sounding a bit like an extension of Rocky Horror Picture Show, which brought Meat Loaf to the national stage). It may be easy to dismiss this as ridiculous, but there\'s real style and craft here and its kitsch is intentional. It may elevate adolescent passion to operatic dimensions, and that\'s certainly silly, but it\'s hard not to marvel at the skill behind this grandly silly, irresistible album.

          summary: 'Success didn\'t change Midnight Oil with their 1990 album Blue Sky Mining. The Australian band had finally broken through with their previous record, Diesel and Dust, but chart accomplishments didn\'t temper the group. Blue Sky Mining found lead singer Peter Garrett and the boys singing about familiar themes with their usual passion. The songs aren\'t quite on par with those from Diesel and Dust, but there\'s still enough here to make it a worthy follow-up. The lead track "Blue Sky Mine" deals with the oppression of the lower working class within the context of a mining company. The immediately catchy cut managed to find mid-chart success. Other notable tracks are the driving "Forgotten Years," which also managed a bit of airplay, and the menacing "Mountains of Burma." The band stumble only once, on the clumsy love song "Shakers and Movers." [A remastered, limited edition of Blue Sky Mining was released in 2014.] ~ Tom Demalon',

          summary: 'Midnight Oil frontman Peter Garrett has long been active in elective politics in Australia, and like any good politician, he knows that sometimes the most important thing is to get your message out to the masses, even it means speaking with a bit less force than might be your custom. While the hard edges and challenging angles of 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and Red Sails in the Sunset made Midnight Oil bona fide superstars in Australia, they were little more than a rumor in most of the rest of the world, and for their sixth album, Diesel and Dust, Midnight Oil made some changes in their approach. On Diesel and Dust, there\'s less in the way of bruising hard rock like "Best of Both Worlds," nothing as eccentric as "Outside World," and very little as esoterically regional as "Jimmy Sharman\'s Boxers," while the production favors the tuneful side of the band\'s songwriting (which, truth to tell, was always there) and buffs away some of the group\'s harsher edges. As a result, Diesel and Dust isn\'t an album for hardcore Oils fans, but as a bid for a larger audience, it was both shrewd and well executed -- it was the group\'s first real worldwide success, going platinum in America and spawning a massive hit single, "Beds Are Burning." While the album lacks the kick-in-the-head impact of their earlier work, Diesel and Dust also makes clear that the bandmembers could apply their intelligence and passion to less aggressive material and still come up with forceful, compelling music, as on the haunting "The Dead Heart" and the poppy but emphatic "Dreamworld." And as always, there was no compromise in the band\'s forceful political stance -- most of the album\'s songs deal openly with the issues of Aboriginal rights (hardly an issue pertinent only to Australians), and one of Midnight Oil\'s greatest victories may well be writing a song explicitly demanding reparations for indigenous peoples, and seeing it top the charts around the world. And the closer, "Sometimes," may be the finest and most moving anthem the band ever wrote ("Sometimes you\'re beaten to the core/Sometimes you\'re taken to the wall/But you don\'t give in"). Diesel and Dust is that rarity, a bid for the larger audience that\'s also an artistic success and a triumph for leftist politics -- even the Clash never managed that hat trick this well. [Diesel and Dust was re-released in 2014.] ~ Mark Deming',

          summary: 'Between 1976 and 1987, the Alan Parsons Project released ten studio albums, most of them going at least gold in the U.S., several generating big hit singles, too. This was enough to sustain a vigorous cult audience well into 2014, which is when Legacy boxed all ten of the Alan Parsons Project albums, adding the scrapped 1981 record The Sicilian Defense to bring in the hardcore who already have purchased this catalog several times over, including deluxe editions that contain bonus material nowhere to be found here. Aside from The Sicilian Defense, a tedious exercise in art rock designed to get APP out of their contract with Arista (it\'s hard not to see why the label asked them to go back in the studio; The Sicilian Defense is all formless instrumentals, lacking the drama of 1980\'s The Turn of a Friendly Card or the crossover soft rock of 1982\'s Eye in the Sky), extras aren\'t the reason to get this set. This is, like so many similar box sets in the 2010s, a tidy and affordable to get a good-sounding, good-looking complete discography from a notable album rock artist, so if you happen to be in the market for a deep dive into the Alan Parsons Project, this is the way to go. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

          summary: 'Tales of Mystery and Imagination is an extremely mesmerizing aural journey through some of Edgar Allan Poe\'s most renowned works. With the use of synthesizers, drums, guitar, and even a glockenspiel, Parsons\' shivering effects make way for an eerie excursion into Poe\'s well-known classics. On the album\'s 1987 remix, the instrumental "Dream Within a Dream" has Orson Welles narrating in front of this wispy collaboration of guitars and keyboards (Welles also narrates "Fall of the House of Usher: Prelude"). The EMI vocoder is used throughout "The Raven" with the Westminster City School Boys Choir mixed in to add a distinct flair to its chamber-like sound. Parsons\' expertise surrounds this album, from the slyness that prevails in "(The System Of) Doctor Tarr and Professor Feather" to the bodeful thumping of the drums that imitate a heartbeat on "The Tell-Tale Heart." "The Fall of the House of Usher" is a lengthy but dazzling array of musicianship that keeps the album\'s persona intact, while enabling the listener to submerge into its frightening atmosphere. With vocalists Terry Sylvester, John Miles, and Eric Woolfson stretched across each track, this variety of different singing styles adds color and design to the album\'s air. Without any underlying theme to be pondered upon, Alan Parsons instead paints a vivid picture of one of the most alluring literary figures in history by musically reciting his most famous works in expert fashion. ~ Mike DeGagne',

          summary: 'At its best, the Romantics\' self-titled debut album sounds like the greatest album Shel Talmy never produced. The Detroit band\'s British Invasion-style power pop may not have been an especially original creation, but it was good enough that no one with a taste for high-voltage hooks would ever dream of complaining, and as a meeting of mid-\'60s style and late-\'70s volume and passion, it\'s all but flawless. The original songs, written by guitarists Wally Palmar and Mike Skill and drummer Jimmy Marinos, are a glorious pastiche of period pop styles (think the Kinks and the Easybeats with a bit of the Hollies thrown in for melodic appeal) played with a hard-stomping energy and a genuine love for the vintage style that doesn\'t reek of nostalgia. The production by Peter Solley is simple but smart enough to put both the hooks at the energy up front where they belong, and the Romantics never had a set of tunes this strong again; "What I Like About You" richly deserved its status as a hit single, and "When I Look in Your Eyes," "Tell It to Carrie" and "Girl Next Door" would have followed it up the charts in a just world. the Romantics didn\'t exactly reinvent the wheel with this album, but they sure knew how to make it roll, and for sheer party enhancing energy, this album is hard to beat.

          summary: 'An even slicker record than Manifesto, Flesh + Blood precariously balances between alluringly seductive, sophisticated soul-pop and cloying, radio-ready disco-pop. At its best, the album is effortlessly suave and charming -- "Over You" is one of their greatest singles, and "Oh Yeah" is nearly as persuasive -- but much of the record is devoted to ill-formed, stylish lounge-pop. In particular, the reliance on reworked covers of "In the Midnight Hour" and "Eight Miles High" is distressing, not only because it signals a lack of imagination, but also because it suggests that Flesh + Blood is simply a lesser solo effort from Bryan Ferry. And even the handful of undeniably strong moments can\'t erase the feeling that Roxy Music were beginning to run out of ideas. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

          summary: 'The 2014 box set The Complete Studio Recordings doesn\'t fail to live up to its title. Every one of Joe Satriani\'s studio albums, beginning with his indie 1985 release Not of This Earth and concluding with 2013\'s Unstoppable Momentum, can be found in a newly remastered version by Satriani and producer John Cuniberti in this attractively priced, clamshell mini-box of CDs presented as mini-LPs. This alone would be a hefty haul -- the set amounts to 14 albums released over the course of nearly three decades -- but for the dedicated there\'s a supplemental compilation called Additional Creations and Bonus Tracks, which rounds up stray songs and unheard cuts. This has its moments, but the main reason to purchase The Complete Studio Recordings is to get Satriani\'s core catalog at an attractive price, especially as the albums sound better than ever. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

          summary: 'Both artistically and commercially, Boz Scaggs had his greatest success with Silk Degrees. The laid-back singer hit the R&B charts in a big way with the addictive, sly "Lowdown" (which has been sampled by more than a few rappers and remains a favorite among baby-boomer soul fans) and expressed his love of smooth soul music almost as well on the appealing "What Can I Say." But Scaggs was essentially a pop/rocker, and in that area he has a considerable amount of fun on "Lido Shuffle" (another major hit single), "What Do You Want the Girl to Do," and "Jump Street." Meanwhile, "We\'re All Alone" and "Harbor Lights" became staples on adult contemporary radio. Though not remarkable, the ballads have more heart than most of the bland material dominating that format. [A 2007 re-release added three bonus tracks, "What Can I Say," "Jump Street," and "It\'s Over."] ~ Alex Henderson',

          summary: 'Only from the Rhino Handmade web-based audio salon could such a fulfilling reissue project have likewise been so thoroughly executed. Keen-eyed and eared pop music enthusiasts will undoubtedly recognize Jack Nitzsche from his involvement with Phil Spector\'s "Wrecking Crew" and later as a producer/arranger and writer for a spectrum of talent that includes but is by no means limited to Leslie Gore, Art Pepper, Tim Buckley, Neil Young, John Tesh, Mink DeVille, and the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. Three Piece Suite: The Reprise Recordings 1971-1974 gathers three disparate sonic situations under which Nitzsche recorded, and of these only the orchestrated St. Giles Cripplegate has been issued in any form. Very little is known with regard to the other recordings, besides the fact that they were on deposit in the Warner Bros. tape archives. St. Giles Cripplegate features the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) performing six original Nitzsche scores. According to Elliot Mazer\'s liner notes essay, the album was the direct result of the jaw-dropping orchestral arrangements Nitzsche had done for Neil Young\'s Harvest album -- specifically on the tracks "There\'s a World" and "A Man Needs a Maid." Although his musical scope was indeed broad by any standards, these sides are more akin to Frank Zappa\'s symphonic experimentations and compositions than anything linked to Nitzsche\'s name. Each of the works is unique, exploring various sonic boundaries. For example, "No. 6" -- the album\'s opener -- is a vertigo-inducing swirl of demented strings and bombastic percussion, capped off with a dramatic brass flourish. This starkly contrasts with the comparably sedate and languid "No. 4 (For Mori)" -- which foreshadows his work on Milos Foreman\'s One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest original soundtrack. The next 11 tracks on this compilation were recorded, assembled, and even bestowed a Reprise catalog number under the eponymous title Jack Nitzsche -- yet the project remained virtually forgotten. According to the thoroughly entertaining discographical annotations, no records exist to confirm exactly who performs on these sides. With a nod to primal Todd Rundgren and the quirky harmonic genius of Brian Wilson, tracks such as "Lower California" and "I\'m the Loneliest Fool" recall the idiosyncratic nature of his collaborative efforts with Van Dyke Parks, and arrangements for Tim Buckley and the Buffalo Springfield. These sides may likely be the greatest discovery the archivists at Rhino Handmade have released. Along with lyrical contributions from director Robert Downey, Nitzsche creates more than music. He is, in effect, altering mood through sound. The disc closes with four demos that chronologically fall between St. Giles Cripplegate and the unissued self-titled project mentioned above. These stark performances reveal a sensitivity and intimacy that were previously only hinted at. According to the liner notes -- which were penned by longtime Nitzsche pal and housemate Denny Bruce -- the track "I\'ll Bet She Knew It" was named after the legendary Jeannie Franklyn, a seamstress in Los Angeles for many a rock & roller. She was likewise immortalized in the song "Tiny Dancer" as the "blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band." Likewise, "Carly" is a tongue-in-cheek paeon to the burgeoning singer/songwriter scare of the early \'70s. Three Piece Suite is limited to an edition of 3,000 copies and available through Rhino Handmade. ~ Lindsay Planer',

          summary: 'The British band Sniff \'n\' the Tears\' 1978 debut, Fickle Heart, is best known for containing the relentlessly catchy rocker "Driver\'s Seat," which became a hit in 1979 and is simply one of the greatest one-hit wonder singles of that decade, and arguably of all time. Killer keyboard and synthesizer riffs by Alan Fealdman and guest Keith Miller, piercing electric guitars by Loz Netto and Mick Dyche, solid bass by Chris Birkin, steady drums by producer Luigi Salvoni, and bandleader/songwriter Paul Roberts\' incessant acoustic rhythm guitar and dramatic lead vocals are all terrific individually, but they add up to a fantastic whole. "Driver\'s Seat" is the leadoff track on Fickle Heart and, while it\'s hard to follow up a classic tune, the album does have some other good songs that are also strong, melodic rock. Sniff \'n\' the Tears is sometimes classified as a new wave band, but that\'s not really accurate. The occasional synthesizer bits spice up Sniff \'n\' the Tears\' music, but they don\'t dominate it. "New Lines on Love" and "This Side of the Blue Horizon" are both richly textured with various keyboards and guitars. "The Thrill of It All" has a dark and mysterious feel due to Roberts\' sly vocal style. "Looking for You" isn\'t as brooding, and the warm keyboard solos are enjoyable. Roberts, an accomplished painter, created the lifelike, photograph-quality cover painting for Fickle Heart and the band\'s subsequent albums. However, Roberts dissolved the Fickle Heart lineup and formed an entirely new version of Sniff \'n\' the Tears for 1980s Games Up. [This edition contains bonus tracks.] ~ Bret Adams',

          summary: 'Essentially a harder-rocking reprise of Every Picture Tells a Story, Never a Dull Moment never quite reaches the heights of its predecessor, but it\'s a wonderful, multi-faceted record in its own right. Opening with the touching, autobiographical rocker "True Blue," which finds Rod Stewart trying to come to grips with his newfound stardom but concluding that he\'d "rather be back home," the record is the last of Stewart\'s series of epic fusions of hard rock and folk. It\'s possible to hear Stewart go for superstardom with the hard-rocking kick and fat electric guitars of the album, but the songs still cut to the core. "You Wear It Well" is a "Maggie May" rewrite on the surface, but it develops into a touching song about being emotionally inarticulate. Similarly, "Lost Paraguayos" is funny, driving folk-rock, and it\'s hard not to be swept away when the Stonesy hard rocker "Italian Girls" soars into a mandolin-driven coda. The covers -- whether a soulful reading of Jimi Hendrix\'s "Angel," an empathetic version of Dylan\'s "Mama, You Been on My Mind," or a stunning interpretation of Etta James\' "I\'d Rather Go Blind" -- are equally effective, making Never a Dull Moment a masterful record. He never got quite this good ever again. [A limited-edition remastered CD was released in 2014.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

          summary: 'In 1982, the unexpected success of the Stray Cats\' American debut, Built for Speed, made America aware that rockabilly, previously believed to be extinct, was actually alive and well somewhere in New Jersey (though the evidence had to be taken to England before anyone would notice). Pulling together six songs from the Stray Cats\' self-titled debut, five tunes from the follow-up Gonna Ball, and one previously unreleased number (the title song), Built for Speed is song-for-song the group\'s strongest album, despite the cut-and-paste manner in which it was created. Originality was never this band\'s strongest suit, and as songwriters the Stray Cats rarely wandered far from the traditional themes of cars, girls, rockin\', and their own level of coolness, but Brian Setzer\'s fleet-fingered guitar work revealed that he\'d absorbed the lessons of Cliff Gallup, James Burton, and Scotty Moore and constructed an impressive and colorful style of his own from the parts, while Lee Rocker and Slim Jim Phantom were an admirably potent and appropriately uncluttered rhythm section (the clean, streamlined production, by Dave Edmunds on most cuts, also helped quite a bit). If the group\'s songs haven\'t all worn the test of time especially well, the melodies are strong and the playing is tight and enthusiastic throughout. While you\'re better off with a good collection from Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, or Charlie Feathers, there are a lot worse ways you could learn about rockabilly than to pick up Built for Speed -- which is a good thing, since if you were born after 1965, chances are it was where you learned about rockabilly. ~ Mark Deming',

          summary: `The problem with defining an era is, what are you going to do for an encore? It's a dilemma that has impaled many a worthy one-hit-wonder in the past, but few struggled more desperately against the inevitable than Thunderclap Newman, the group that could...nay, should...have defined the first half of the 1970s for anyone tired of the '60s supergroups, but who vanished instead into the box marked "Whatever Happened To?"␊
          That, of course, is another essay entirely. But their immediate future -- that is, the weeks and months that followed the worldwide success of "Something in the Air" -- caught them creating one of the key albums of the age, a set that confirmed Speedy Keen among the finest British songwriters of his generation; that brought Pete Townshend production kudos that he never even tried to touch again; that bristled with at least half a dozen more surefire monster hits...and which sank like the proverbial stone. And still no one can tell you why.␊
          A re-recorded take on the hit opens the album; intriguingly, elements of the song's multitudinous hooks then appear and reappear throughout the remainder of the set -- a piano riff here, a bassline there. It brings a continuity to the album that puts one in mind of the similar tricks played by labelmates The Crazy World of Arthur Brown on their 1968 debut album, but they spread the joy over one side of the album only. Hollywood Dream bristles with hints and reminders, to bring the album an almost conceptual sheen, at the same time as the songs themselves race away in a dozen different directions. ␊
          Three parts of "Hollywood" offer up a deliciously cynical examination of the movie scene, buoyed by an almost childishly lovely melody; "Accidents," on the other hand, flips from a guilt-ridden catalog of childhood mishaps to a blindingly psychedelic instrumental passage -- at nine minutes, the album version is thrice as long as the maybe-familiar 45 rpm cut, and it's no exaggeration to say it's three times better, as well.␊
          From start to finish, then, Hollywood Dream is, indeed, a dream, an album for everyone and for all occasions. If you don't own it, you need to. And if you do, then why aren't you listening to it right now? ~ Dave Thompson`,

          summary: 'It\'s as easy to see why radio listeners loved Toto as it is to see why critics hated them. Toto\'s rock-studio chops allowed them to play any current pop style at the drop of a hi-hat: one minute prog rock, the next hard rock, the next funky R&B. It all sounded great, but it also implied that music-making took craft rather than inspiration and that the musical barriers critics like to erect were arbitrary. Then, too, Toto\'s timing couldn\'t have been much worse. They rode in during the middle of punk/new wave with its D.I.Y. aesthetic, and their sheer competence was an affront. Of course, there\'s always been an alternate history of popular music not available to rock critics (it\'s written in record stores and concert halls and on the radio), and in that story, Toto was a smash. Singles like "I\'ll Supply the Love" and "Georgy Porgy" (featuring Cheryl Lynn) made the charts, and "Hold the Line" hit the Top Ten and went gold. The members of Toto had already influenced the course of \'70s popular music by playing on half the albums that came out of L.A. All they were doing with this album was going public.

          summary: 'Rhino reissued expanded versions of all the Yes albums in the early days of the new millennium, so this 2013 set doesn\'t see either a massive sonic upgrade or expansion. Instead, those acclaimed remasters -- including the expansion of Big Generator, which hadn\'t seen U.S. release prior to this -- are now packaged in mini-LP cardboard sleeves and put into a box with new artwork designed by Roger Dean. Apart from the art, this may not offer hardcore Yes fans anything they don\'t already have -- that\'s assuming they didn\'t opt to purchase an import of Big Generator in the first place -- but this is an easy, attractive, and relatively affordable way to get the band\'s core catalog in one fell swoop. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

          summary: 'Johnny Cash\'s first album, released on Sun in 1957, is a little more folkloric and traditional than what he put on most of his singles, though not pronouncedly so. In fact, four of the tracks ("I Walk the Line," "Cry! Cry! Cry!," "So Doggone Lonesome," and "Folsom Prison Blues") had already been hit singles. For the rest of the set, Cash drew on some older folk ("Rock Island Line," "The Wreck of the Old \'97"), country ("[I Heard That] Lonesome Whistle," "Remember Me [I\'m the One Who Loves You]"), prison ("Doin\' My Time"), and spiritual ("I Was There When It Happened") songs. Filling out the set is a good, rollicking Cash original, "Country Boy," and a rather sassy tune by the young Jerry Reed, "If the Good Lord\'s Willing." It\'s a good, solid record that\'s very much in the mold of his classic early Sun sound, with spare accompaniment that nevertheless often approaches a rockabilly-country bounce. ~ Richie Unterberger',

          summary: 'With their surprise success behind them, the Cranberries went ahead and essentially created a sequel to Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\'t We with only tiny variations, with mixed results. The fact that the album is essentially a redo of previously established stylistic ground isn\'t apparent in just the production, handled again by Stephen Street, or the overall sound, or even that one particularly fine song is called "Dreaming My Dreams." Everybody wasn\'t a laugh riot, to be sure, but No Need to Argue starts to see O\'Riordan take a more commanding and self-conscious role that ended up not standing the band in good stead later. Lead single "Zombie" is the offender in this regard -- the heavy rock trudge isn\'t immediately suited for the band\'s strengths (notably, O\'Riordan wrote this without Noel Hogan) -- while the subject matter (the continuing Northern Ireland tensions) ends up sounding trivialized. Opening cut "Ode to My Family" is actually one of the band\'s best, with a lovely string arrangement created by O\'Riordan, her overdubbed vocals showing her distinct vocal tics. Where No Need succeeds best is when the Cranberries stick at what they know, resulting in a number of charmers like "Twenty One," the uilleann pipes-touched "Daffodil\'s Lament," which has an epic sweep that doesn\'t overbear like "Zombie," and the evocative "Disappointment."

          summary: 'In a word, stunning. Perhaps an odd word to use given that Violator continued in the general vein of the previous two studio efforts by Depeche Mode: Martin Gore\'s upfront lyrical emotional extremism and knack for a catchy hook filtered through Alan Wilder\'s ear for perfect arrangements, ably assisted by top English producer Flood. Yet the idea that this record would both dominate worldwide charts, while song for song being simply the best, most consistent effort yet from the band could only have been the wildest fantasy before its release. The opening two singles from the album, however, signaled something was up. First was "Personal Jesus," at once perversely simplistic, with a stiff, arcane funk/hip-hop beat and basic blues guitar chords, and tremendous, thanks to sharp production touches and David Gahan\'s echoed, snaky vocals. Then "Enjoy the Silence," a nothing-else-remains-but-us ballad pumped up into a huge, dramatic romance/dance number, commanding in its mock orchestral/choir scope. Follow-up single "Policy of Truth" did just fine as well, a low-key Motown funk number for the modern day with a sharp love/hate lyric to boot. To top it all off, the album itself scored on song after song, from the shuffling beat of "Sweetest Perfection" (well sung by Gore) and the ethereal "Waiting for the Night" to the guilt-ridden-and-loving-it "Halo" building into a string-swept pounder. "Clean" wraps up Violator on an eerie note, all ominous bass notes and odd atmospherics carrying the song. Goth without ever being stupidly hammy, synth without sounding like the clinical stereotype of synth music, rock without ever sounding like a "rock" band, Depeche here reach astounding heights indeed.

          summary: `It's a bit tempting to peg Green Day's sprawling, ambitious, brilliant seventh album, American Idiot, as their version of a Who album, the next logical step forward from the Kinks-inspired popcraft of their underrated 2000 effort, Warning, but things aren't quite that simple. American Idiot is an unapologetic, unabashed rock opera, a form that Pete Townshend pioneered with Tommy, but Green Day doesn't use that for a blueprint as much as they use the Who's mini-opera "A Quick One, While He's Away," whose whirlwind succession of 90-second songs isn't only emulated on two song suites here, but provides the template for the larger 13-song cycle. But the Who are only one of many inspirations on this audacious, immensely entertaining album. The story of St. Jimmy has an arc similar to Hüsker Dü's landmark punk-opera Zen Arcade, while the music has grandiose flourishes straight out of both Queen and Rocky Horror Picture Show (the '50s pastiche "Rock and Roll Girlfriend" is punk rock Meat Loaf), all tied together with a nervy urgency and a political passion reminiscent of the Clash, or all the anti-Reagan American hardcore bands of the '80s. These are just the clearest touchstones for American Idiot, but reducing the album to its influences gives the inaccurate impression that this is no more than a patchwork quilt of familiar sounds, when it's an idiosyncratic, visionary work in its own right. First of all, part of Green Day's appeal is how they have personalized the sounds of the past, making time-honored guitar rock traditions seem fresh, even vital. With their first albums, they styled themselves after first-generation punk they were too young to hear firsthand, and as their career progressed, the group not only synthesized these influences into something distinctive, but chief songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong turned into a muscular, versatile songwriter in his own right. ␍␊
          Warning illustrated their growing musical acumen quite impressively, but here, the music isn't only tougher, it's fluid and, better still, it fuels the anger, disillusionment, heartbreak, frustration, and scathing wit at the core of American Idiot. And one of the truly startling things about American Idiot is how the increased musicality of the band is matched by Armstrong's incisive, cutting lyrics, which effectively convey the paranoia and fear of living in American in days after 9/11, but also veer into moving, intimate small-scale character sketches. There's a lot to absorb here, and cynics might dismiss it after one listen as a bit of a mess when it's really a rich, multi-faceted work, one that is bracing upon the first spin and grows in stature and becomes more addictive with each repeated play. Like all great concept albums, American Idiot works on several different levels. It can be taken as a collection of great songs -- songs that are as visceral or as poignant as Green Day at their best, songs that resonate outside of the larger canvas of the story, as the fiery anti-Dubya title anthem proves -- but these songs have a different, more lasting impact when taken as a whole. While its breakneck, freewheeling musicality has many inspirations, there really aren't many records like American Idiot (bizarrely enough, the Fiery Furnaces' Blueberry Boat is one of the closest, at least on a sonic level, largely because both groups draw deeply from the kaleidoscopic "A Quick One"). In its musical muscle and sweeping, politically charged narrative, it's something of a masterpiece, and one of the few -- if not the only -- records of 2004 to convey what it feels like to live in the strange, bewildering America of the early 2000s. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine`,

          summary: `It may be far too obvious to even mention that Norah Jones' follow-up to her 18-million-unit-selling, eight-Grammy-winning, genre-bending, super-smash album Come Away with Me has perhaps a bit too much to live up to. But that's probably the biggest conundrum for Jones: having to follow up the phenomenal success of an album that was never designed to be so hugely popular in the first place. Come Away with Me was a little album by an unknown pianist/vocalist who attempted to mix jazz, country, and folk in an acoustic setting -- who knew? Feels Like Home could be seen as "Come Away with Me Again" if not for that fact that it's actually better. Smartly following the template forged by Jones and producer Arif Mardin, there is the intimate single "Sunrise," some reworked cover tunes, some interesting originals, and one ostensible jazz standard. These are all good things, for also like its predecessor, Feels Like Home is a soft and amiable album that frames Jones' soft-focus Aretha Franklin voice with a group of songs that are as classy as they are quiet. Granted, not unlike the dippy albeit catchy hit "Don't Know Why," they often portend deep thoughts but come off in the end more like heartfelt daydreams. Of course, Jones could sing the phone book and make it sound deep, and that's what's going to keep listeners coming back. ␍␊
          What's surprising here are the bluesy, more jaunty songs that really dig into the country stylings only hinted at on Come Away with Me. To these ends, the infectious shuffle of "What Am I to You?" finds Jones truly coming into her own as a blues singer as well as a writer. Her voice has developed a spine-tingling breathy scratch that pulls on your ear as she rises to the chorus. Similarly, "Toes" and "Carnival Town" -- co-written by bassist Lee Alexander and Jones -- are pure '70s singer/songwriting that call to mind a mix of Rickie Lee Jones and k.d. lang. Throw in covers of Tom Waits and Townes Van Zandt along with Duke Ellington's "Melancholia," retitled here "Don't Miss You at All" and featuring lyrics by Jones, and you've got an album so blessed with superb songwriting that Jones' vocals almost push the line into too much of a good thing. Thankfully, there is also a rawness and organic soulfulness in the production that's refreshing. No digital pitch correction was employed in the studio and you can sometimes catch Jones hitting an endearingly sour note. She also seems to be making good on her stated desire to remain a part of a band. Most all of her sidemen, who've worked with the likes of Tom Waits and Cassandra Wilson, get writing credits. It's a "beauty and the beast" style partnership that harks back to the best Brill Building-style intentions and makes for a quietly experimental and well-balanced album. ~ Matt Collar`,

          summary: 'It\'s no secret that the Leeds-based Kaiser Chiefs love the Jam. The band\'s 2005 excellent but uneven debut Employment was an infectious salute to all things mod and Brit-pop, boasting three solid singles ("I Predict a Riot," "Oh My God" and "Everyday I Love You Less and Less") that held great promise for future endeavors. On Yours Truly, Angry Mob, the group takes a little more time in establishing its pop acumen, offering no immediate pay-offs despite its insatiable thirst for FM melody. Opener and first single "Ruby," a rowdy, mid-tempo singalong that gets everything right but feels a little tossed-off and disposable, is indicative of Angry Mob\'s first half -- "Heat Dies Down," "Love\'s Not a Competition (But I\'m Winning)" and "Highroyds" have all of their cogs well-oiled and reliably dressed, but there\'s nothing here that warrants the inevitable second listen in which a perfectly constructed pop song\'s true genius is revealed. To that end, Angry Mob is creatively back loaded (though not genius), relying on a series of rewarding and occasionally subversive tracks like "I Can Do It Without You," "Learnt My Lesson Well," "My Kind of Guy" and closer "Retirement" to avoid the dreaded sophomore slump, revealing a band that is likely to continue pumping out albums with a few great songs on them until the requisite "Greatest Hits" collection arrives. [Yours Truly, Angry Mob is also available in an edition with three bonus tracks and a bonus DVD.] ~ James Christopher Monger',

          summary: 'The Kooks arrived fully formed in 2006, for their debut sounds like the work of a band well into its career: the confidence with which the foursome from Brighton play and the abandon with which Luke Pritchard sings; the witty songcraft and deft arrangements; the drama and fervor they unleash from the very first notes and carry through to the end. They display maturity but also play with the fervor of kids and project a wide-eyed charm that is very endearing. On most of Inside In/Inside Out, the band sounds like a more energetic Thrills or a looser Sam Roberts Band, maybe even a less severe Arctic Monkeys at times. Along with these modern kinships and influences, the band is heavily indebted to classic rock. Traces of Thin Lizzy\'s romantic lyricism pop up on tracks like "Eddie\'s Gun," and so does a bit of post-punk spikiness on "You Don\'t Love Me," some Dexys singalong booziness on "She Moves in Her Own Way," and a hint of jam-band funk on "Match Box." Quite varied influences, and in the end the band sounds like the Kooks and no one else. A nice and unique sound doesn\'t mean much without some songs to fill it out, and the Kooks deliver plenty of memorable tunes. "Eddie\'s Gun," "See the World," the unfortunately named "Jackie Big Tits," and "Ooh La" are very strong and, taken together, equal the output of just about any pop/rock band around in 2006. The only song that falls flat is the over-long reggae-rocker "Time Awaits." It\'s the only track that breaks the four-minute mark, and it shows that the Kooks\' strength isn\'t stretching out and jamming; their chops are best suited for short, sharp blasts of invigorating pop/rock. When they stick to that, the Kooks are an exciting, very promising band, and Inside In/Inside Out is an excellent debut. [Inside In/Inside Out was released on LP in 2016.] ~ Tim Sendra',

          summary: 'Muse lead vocalist Matthew Bellamy\'s vocal timbre bears some similarity to that of Thom Yorke, leading some to dismiss Muse as simply a band of Radiohead worshipers. With Absolution, however, the group proves that it\'s much more than the sum of its influences, delivering a work that revels in the enormity of its ambition, the breadth of its sonic palette, and the intensity of its emotional resonance. Employing a daring mix of classical-influenced piano and strings, metallic guitars, unabashedly strident house-style synths, and the type of production bombast usually reserved for Queen or ELO, Muse often sound like an otherworldly jam session between Rufus Wainwright, the Move, and Evanescence. Packed with both pop hooks and unusual instrumental textures, Absolution invites listeners to expect the unexpected. ~ Pemberton Roach',

          summary: 'The surprise hit of the 1994 summer movie season traces the life of a half-wit through the major historical events of the 1950s, \'60s, and \'70s, and this soundtrack album is a travelogue of the same period, from Elvis Presley\'s 1956 hit "Hound Dog" to Bob Seger\'s 1980 hit "Against the Wind." Like the movie, the soundtrack to Forrest Gump succeeds at repackaging the familiar -- in the film, we revisit everything from desegregation and the Vietnam War to the self-centered trends of the \'70s, and on the soundtrack, we hear the concurrent hits for the umpteenth time -- although, unlike the movie, the soundtrack doesn\'t trivialize what it recycles. Playing it is basically like listening to an oldies radio station, minus the commercials and annoying DJ patter, but just like many other song-oriented soundtracks, this is still a miscellaneous collection. That, however, didn\'t keep it from shooting into the Top Ten as the movie became a blockbuster. The double-CD version contains eight more tracks than the cassette. ~ William Ruhlmann',

          summary: 'The problem with compiling an essential best-of compilation covering the phenomenon that was (and is) Elvis Presley is the very man himself, who has passed from this mortal coil into the iconic pop culture stratosphere where even his own death is questioned and Elvis sightings are as frequent as fleas. Then there are the thousands of performers who daily dress up as Presley himself and sally forth into the world like perfectly gyrating replicas of either the early or later Elvis (body physics dictate that you can\'t be both). Elvis may have left the building, but not really. His image is everywhere, and his fans are legion and devout. So how does one pick his essential sides when "Do the Clam" is a classic in the Kingdom of Presley simply because Elvis did it? He recorded Tony Joe White\'s "Polk Salad Annie" in 1970. It was hardly the best version ever of "Polk Salad Annie" but it was Elvis\' version of "Polk Salad Annie," which puts it in rarefied class of its own, and making it, like "Do the Clam," absolutely essential in some quarters. When you\'re larger than life, words like essential have to expand or be left wanting. The Essential Elvis Presley boils this imposing legacy down to two discs of 20 tracks each, and approaches the problem of what is truly essential by choosing to compile all of Elvis\' significant charting hits, beginning with his 1954 cover of Arthur Crudup\'s "That\'s All Right" from Sam Phillips\' Sun Records and continuing chronologically through Presley\'s long association with RCA Records through the year 1976. That means, while there\'s no version of "Do the Clam" ("Polk Salad Annie" is here, though), there are classic sides like 1956\'s "Heartbreak Hotel," "Don\'t Be Cruel," "Hound Dog," and "Love Me Tender," 1957\'s "Jailhouse Rock," 1961\'s "Little Sister," and 1969\'s "In the Ghetto," "Suspicious Minds," and "Kentucky Rain." There are 17 number one hits and a whole lot more. Elvis fanatics are going to complain about what isn\'t here, of course. Elvis is the King, after all, and therefore by definition everything he recorded ought to be essential. And everything he recorded is indeed essential on some level. But these are the sides that broke through to the deepest level of the world pop culture that Elvis helped create. These are the songs that broke him and then sustained him on radio and television and at the movie theaters. Die-hard Elvis fans will undoubtedly already have everything collected here. This is a set instead for folks who want to have at least one Elvis anthology in their collections, and want the hits they remember and don\'t much care if those hits are from the early Elvis or the later Elvis or the dear departed Elvis. Just the hits, bartender, shaken not stirred. That means no version of "Do the Clam," singular as it is. ~ Steve Leggett',

          summary: 'On Begin to Hope, Regina Spektor treads a delicate balance between her anti-folk past and her present home on Sire Records. Though the label re-released Soviet Kitsch in 2004, Begin to Hope is Spektor\'s first original material for Sire, and it feels more like a major-label debut than Soviet Kitsch ever did. The album\'s big, glossy production and preponderance of drum machines and keyboards inches Spektor toward territory that isn\'t exactly mainstream, but is closer to a more conventional adult alternative singer/songwriter sound. Her songwriting mirrors this, too: "Field Below," which finds her wishing for the countryside while living in the city, has a mellow, appealingly rambling vibe that grows from the traditional singer/songwriter roots of Joni and Carole; "Better" takes the breathy, literate, pretty side of Spektor\'s music and tailors it into a radio-friendly single. "On the Radio" takes it a step further and becomes a smart, funny, and sad meta-single, with lyrics like "We listened to it twice/Because the DJ was asleep" backed by poppy synths and beats. But even though Begin to Hope\'s first few songs might suggest otherwise, Spektor is much too freewheeling and quirky a talent to stick to the straight and narrow for the entirety. Show tunes, classic soul, the Bible, and the backs of cereal boxes are all inspirations for the album. And whether she quotes the melody from Doris Payne\'s "Just One Look" and pairs it with lyrics about orca whales on "Hotel Song," or begins the lovely, confessional closing track, "Summer in the City," with the line "summer in the city means cleavage," Spektor uses them in unexpected ways. She also places some truly surreal, heady tracks toward Begin to Hope\'s end: "Lady" is a torchy number arranged for piano, saxophone, and typewriter, while "20 Years of Snow" is buoyed along by impressionistic keyboards that twinkle and tumble like a just-shaken snow globe. "Apres Moi," one of the album\'s most impressive tracks, showcases her classical piano training, her Russian heritage, and those biblical influences to ominous, paranoid effect. Leaving the more unique, quintessentially Regina Spektor-esque tracks at the end of Begin to Hope isn\'t so much a bait-and-switch as is a clever way to lure in and loosen the inhibitions of new fans. The album feels like getting to really know someone: at first, it\'s polite and a little restrained, but then its real personality, with all of its charming idiosyncrasies, finally reveals itself. ~ Heather Phares',

          summary: 'Regina Spektor worked with no less than four big-name producers on Far, all of them with very different backgrounds: David Kahne was her collaborator on 2006\'s Begin to Hope; Garret "Jacknife" Lee counts R.E.M. and U2 among his credits; Jeff Lynne\'s lavish sound is famous on ELO\'s albums; and Mike Elizondo has worked with Fiona Apple and Maroon 5. It\'s something of a surprise, then, that Far sounds so homogenized. On Soviet Kitsch and Begin to Hope, Spektor\'s wide-eyed moments were balanced with darker, knowing songs that kept her music grounded. Here, almost all of the rough or unpredictable edges have been smoothed away, and all that\'s left is Spektor\'s sweet, quirky side. At times, Far gets close to being unbearably precious, whether it\'s putting Spektor\'s name in all lowercase letters in the liner notes, her dolphin on the otherwise charming "Folding Chair," or lyrics like "We made our own computer out of macaroni pieces" on the chirpy opener, "The Calculation." Even the album\'s darker tracks, such as the percussion-heavy "Machine," are surprisingly sugary compared to her previous work. However, Spektor\'s guileless voice and delivery allow her to get away with sounds and ideas that would be horribly cloying in the hands of almost any other artist. She manages to make a song with the chorus "Eet, eet, eet" catchy and affecting, and fashions an observant and witty story out of returning a wallet to Blockbuster Video. Still, Far\'s best moments occur when Spektor turns down the whimsy a few notches. It\'s probably not a coincidence that the Kahne-produced "Human of the Year" shares some of Begin to Hope\'s intimacy and ambition, but "Blue Lips" and "Man of a Thousand Faces" also let Spektor\'s more mature -- but not overly serious -- side shine. Likewise, "Two Birds" and "One More Time with Feeling" show that she hasn\'t lost her touch for deceptively pretty pop with clever lyrics. While Far is far from bad, it doesn\'t quite live up to expectations, either, based on all the talent involved in making it and how fully Spektor expressed herself on Begin to Hope. ~ Heather Phares',

          summary: 'Opening with the ominous, fiery protest of "Sunday Bloody Sunday," War immediately announces itself as U2\'s most focused and hardest-rocking album to date. Blowing away the fuzzy, sonic indulgences of October with propulsive, martial rhythms and shards of guitar, War bristles with anger, despair, and above all, passion. Previously, Bono\'s attempts at messages came across as grandstanding, but his vision becomes remarkably clear on this record, as his anthems ("New Year\'s Day," "40," "Seconds") are balanced by effective, surprisingly emotional love songs ("Two Hearts Beat as One"), which are just as desperate and pleading as his protests. He performs the difficult task of making the universal sound personal, and the band helps him out by bringing the songs crashing home with muscular, forceful performances that reveal their varied, expressive textures upon repeated listens. U2 always aimed at greatness, but War was the first time they achieved it. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

          summary: 'The story of Back to Black is one in which celebrity and the potential of commercial success threaten to ruin Amy Winehouse, since the same insouciance and playfulness that made her sound so special when she debuted could easily have been whitewashed right out of existence for this breakout record. (That fact may help to explain why fans were so scared by press allegations that Winehouse had deliberately lost weight in order to present a slimmer appearance.) Although Back to Black does see her deserting jazz and wholly embracing contemporary R&B, all the best parts of her musical character emerge intact, and actually, are all the better for the transformation from jazz vocalist to soul siren. With producer Salaam Remi returning from Frank, plus the welcome addition of Mark Ronson (fresh off successes producing for Christina Aguilera and Robbie Williams), Back to Black has a similar sound to Frank but much more flair and spark to it. Winehouse was inspired by girl group soul of the \'60s, and fortunately Ronson and Remi are two of the most facile and organic R&B producers active. (They certainly know how to evoke the era too; Remi\'s "Tears Dry on Their Own" is a sparkling homage to the Motown chestnut "Ain\'t No Mountain High Enough," and Ronson summons a host of Brill Building touchstones on his tracks.) As before, Winehouse writes all of the songs from her experiences, most of which involve the occasionally riotous and often bittersweet vagaries of love. Also in similar fashion to Frank, her eye for details and her way of relating them are delightful. She states her case against "Rehab" on the knockout first single with some great lines: "They tried to make me go to rehab I won\'t go go go, I\'d rather be at home with Ray" (Charles, that is). As often as not, though, the songs on Back to Black are universal, songs that anyone, even Joss Stone, could take to the top of the charts, such as "Love Is a Losing Game" or the title song ("We only said good bye with words, I died a hundred times/You go back to her, and I go back to black"). ~ John Bush',

          summary: 'The John Butler Trio, Australia’s biggest contribution to the jam band movement, gets a serious makeover on 2010\'s April Uprising. Butler dissolved the previous lineup one year before this album’s release, hoping to keep things fresh with a change in personnel. Newcomers Byron Luiters and Nicky Bomba (Butler’s brother-in-law) make their debut here, and the band further reinvents itself by sticking closer to the alt-rock camp than ever before, with Butler trading his fingerplucked guitar arpeggios for electric riffs and power chords. He’s not entirely done with the genres that fueled his earlier albums -- reggae, folk, pop, and acoustic soul chief among them -- and songs like “Don’t Wanna See Your Face” are familiarly funky, with grooves specifically designed for the festival crowds that sustain the John Butler Trio every summer. Even so, April Uprising signals a change in direction, with a newfound emphasis on rock textures and political lyrics (“Sometimes I do wonder how we do sleep/Serving the dodgy companies we keep”) that make the band sound like a flashier, Aussie equivalent of State Radio. ~ Andrew Leahey',

          summary: 'The sixth long player from the rootsy Australian trio (and first outing in four years) finds bandleader John Butler occupying a more introspective and nostalgic headspace than he has on previous outings. Butler has always been a cerebral gent, although one prone to crafting stadium sized activist anthems like "Earthbound Child" and "Fire in the Sky," but there\'s a more settled vibe to Flesh + Blood that suggests a possible sea change. Opener "Spring to Come," which begins with the lyric "Lost my love, lost my light" and concludes with the line "After a lonely long night comes the sun," sets the mood, offering up a solid foundation of fluid fingerpicking and circular, warm weather rhythms and melodies for Butler to opine over. It\'s a tone and sentiment that occurs frequently throughout the album\'s surprisingly concise (for a jam band) fifty-two minute runtime, and it serves the trio well, especially on more contemplative cuts like "Bullet Girl," "Only One," and the lovely and languid Ainslie Wills-assisted "Young and Wild." To be fair, JBT fans looking for bolder, more familiar strokes have more than a few traditional roots-rock offerings to sift through, some of them solid (the dark and immersive "Cold Wind" and the fun, if not a tad derivative "Livin\' in the City") and some of them not (the turgid, reggae/blues-rock epic "Blame it on Me" and its throwaway, whitebread counterpart "Devil Woman"), but it\'s in the more refined, self reflective moments where Butler, bassist Byron Luiters, and drummer Nicky Bomba really come alive. ~ James Christopher Monger',

          summary: 'James Bay is a young British singer and songwriter whose heartfelt songs and passionate vocal style suggest a greater maturity and experience than one would expect from an artist whose debut album was released when he was 24 years old. Chaos and the Calm, Bay\'s first full-length album following a pair of well-received EPs, reveals he has a precocious talent as a songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist, and is just as comfortable with outgoing tracks like "Collide" as he is with intimate, personal numbers such as "Let It Go" as he winds together elements of pop, folk, rock, blues, and soul. Often compared to Ed Sheeran and Ben Howard, Chaos and the Calm shows James Bay has the style and the ability to stand on his own, and it\'s the work of a new performer with an impressive potential.

          summary: `American V: A Hundred Highways is the long-awaited album of Johnny Cash's final recordings, the basic tracks for which (i.e., Cash's vocals) were recorded in 2002-2003, with overdubs added by producer Rick Rubin after his death on September 12, 2003, at age 71. Between 1994 and 2002, Cash and Rubin had succeeded in fashioning a third act for the veteran country singer's career, following his acclaimed 1950s work for Sun Records and his popular recordings for Columbia in the 1960s and '70s. In the '80s, Cash's star had faded, but Rubin reinvented him as a hip country-folk-rock elder at 62 with American Recordings (1994), his first new studio album to reach the pop charts in 18 years. Unchained (1996) and American III: Solitary Man (2000) continued the comeback, at least as far as the critics were concerned, though none of the albums was actually a big seller. But American IV: The Man Comes Around (2002), propelled by Cash's cover of Nine Inch Nails' "Hurt" and a powerful video, stayed in the pop charts longer than any Cash album since 1969's Johnny Cash at San Quentin. By 2002, however, Cash was in failing health, homebound and in a wheelchair, and he suffered a personal blow when his wife, June Carter Cash, died on May 15, 2003.  The American series, which posited Cash as an aged sage and the repository for a bottomless American songbook, had already shown a predilection for gloom in the name of gravity; it's no surprise that the fifth and final volume would be even more concerned with, as three earlier Cash compilations had put it, God, Love, and Murder. The ailing septuagenarian certainly sounds like he's near the end of his life, but that said, he doesn't sound bad. Cash was never a great singer in a technical sense: he hadn't much range, his pitch often wobbled, and his lack of breath control sometimes found him grasping for sound at the end of lines. But he was a great singer in the sense of projecting a persona through his voice; his emotional range, which went from a Sinatra-like swagger to an almost embarrassingly intimate vulnerability, was as wide as the spread of notes he could hit confidently was narrow. Such a singer doesn't really lose that much with age; in fact, he gains even more interpretive depth. Listening to this album, one can't get around the knowledge that it is a posthumous collection made in Cash's last days, but even without that context, it would have much the same impact. ␍␊
          The album begins with two religious songs, Larry Gatlin's "Help Me," a plea to God, and the traditional "God's Gonna Cut You Down," which, in a sense, answers that plea. The finality of death thus established, Cash launches into what is billed as the last song he ever wrote, "Like the 309," which is about a train taking his casket away. The same image is used later in the cover of Hank Williams' "On the Evening Train," in which a man and his child put the coffin of a wife and mother on another train. Cash sings these songs in a restrained manner, and even has a sense of humor in "Like the 309," in which he complains about his asthma: "It should be awhile/Before I see Doctor Death/So it would sure be nice/If I could get my breath." In between the two train songs come songs that may not have been about death when their authors wrote them, but sure sound like they are here. As written, Gordon Lightfoot's "If You Could Read My Mind" seems to concern a romantic breakup expressed in literary and cinematic terms, but in Cash's voice, lines like "You know that ghost is me" and "But stories always end" become inescapably elegiac. Bruce Springsteen's "Further On (Up the Road)" is even easier to interpret as a call to the hereafter, with lines like "Got on my dead man's suit and my smilin' skull ring/My lucky graveyard boots and song to sing." These two songs make a pair with the album's two closing songs. Ian Tyson's "Four Strong Winds" is, like the Lightfoot selection, a folk standard by a Canadian songwriter, also nominally about romantic dissolution, although here the singer who is "bound for moving on" doesn't seem likely to come back. And the closing song, "I'm Free from the Chain Gang Now," may have lyrics implying that the unjustly imprisoned narrator has been set free, but in Cash's voice it sounds like he's been executed instead and is singing from beyond the grave. The four songs in between "On the Evening Train" and "Four Strong Winds," dealing with faith and love (the former expressed in a previously recorded 1984 Cash copyright, "I Came to Believe"), are weaker than what surrounds them, but they serve to complete the picture. And it's worth noting that Cash at death's door still outsings croaking Rod McKuen on the songwriter's ever-cloying "Love's Been Good to Me." Cash may never have heard Rubin's overdubs, but they are restrained and tasteful, never doing anything more than to support the singer and the song. If the entire series of American recordings makes for a fitting finale to a great career, American V: A Hundred Highways is a more than respectable coda. ~William Ruhlmann`,

          summary: 'Coldplay finally surrender to their essential good nature on Mylo Xyloto, their fifth album and first to ditch all pretense of brooding melancholia. Which isn’t to say the band doesn’t drift along on some pleasingly spacy atmospheres conjured by longtime producer Brian Eno: there’s still a veneer of classy disaffection that inevitably dissipates due to the relentless sunniness of Chris Martin and company. Eno\'s echoes and ambience -- the only things that still mark Coldplay as anything resembling progressive -- positively sparkle when they meet the band’s bright, chipper melodies, yet Coldplay\'s innate good manners restrain the album, keeping it just this side of a rush of candied pop. Such politeness can verge on the dull -- criminally so when they bring Rihanna in for “Princess of China,” a duet so toothless she may as well have stayed home -- but Mylo Xyloto has a leg up on other Coldplay records for this simple reason: they’re no longer attempting to mimic U2\'s portentous piety. They’ve embraced their schoolboy selves and are simply singing songs of love and good cheer, albeit on a grand scale that somehow seems smaller due to the group’s insuppressible niceness. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

          summary: 'Guns N\' Roses\' debut, Appetite for Destruction was a turning point for hard rock in the late \'80s -- it was a dirty, dangerous, and mean record in a time when heavy metal meant nothing but a good time. On the surface, Guns N\' Roses may appear to celebrate the same things as their peers -- namely, sex, liquor, drugs, and rock & roll -- but there is a nasty edge to their songs, since Axl Rose doesn\'t see much fun in the urban sprawl of L.A. and its parade of heavy metal thugs, cheap women, booze, and crime. The music is as nasty as the lyrics, wallowing in a bluesy, metallic hard rock borrowed from Aerosmith, AC/DC, and countless faceless hard rock bands of the early \'80s. It\'s a primal, sleazy sound that adds grit to already grim tales. It also makes Rose\'s misogyny, fear, and anger hard to dismiss as merely an artistic statement; this is music that sounds lived-in. And that\'s exactly why Appetite for Destruction is such a powerful record -- not only does Rose have fears, but he also is vulnerable, particularly on the power ballad "Sweet Child O\' Mine." He also has a talent for conveying the fears and horrors of the decaying inner city, whether it\'s on the charging "Welcome to the Jungle," the heroin ode "Mr. Brownstone," or "Paradise City," which simply wants out. But as good as Rose\'s lyrics and screeching vocals are, they wouldn\'t be nearly as effective without the twin-guitar interplay of Slash and Izzy Stradlin, who spit out riffs and solos better than any band since the Rolling Stones, and that\'s what makes Appetite for Destruction the best metal record of the late \'80s.

          summary: 'Off the Wall was a massive success, spawning four Top Ten hits (two of them number ones), but nothing could have prepared Michael Jackson for Thriller. Nobody could have prepared anybody for the success of Thriller, since the magnitude of its success was simply unimaginable -- an album that sold 40 million copies in its initial chart run, with seven of its nine tracks reaching the Top Ten (for the record, the terrific "Baby Be Mine" and the pretty good ballad "The Lady in My Life" are not like the others). This was a record that had something for everybody, building on the basic blueprint of Off the Wall by adding harder funk, hard rock, softer ballads, and smoother soul -- expanding the approach to have something for every audience. That alone would have given the album a good shot at a huge audience, but it also arrived precisely when MTV was reaching its ascendancy, and Jackson helped the network by being not just its first superstar, but first black star as much as the network helped him. This all would have made it a success (and its success, in turn, served as a new standard for success), but it stayed on the charts, turning out singles, for nearly two years because it was really, really good. True, it wasn\'t as tight as Off the Wall -- and the ridiculous, late-night house-of-horrors title track is the prime culprit, arriving in the middle of the record and sucking out its momentum -- but those one or two cuts don\'t detract from a phenomenal set of music. It\'s calculated, to be sure, but the chutzpah of those calculations (before this, nobody would even have thought to bring in metal virtuoso Eddie Van Halen to play on a disco cut) is outdone by their success. This is where a song as gentle and lovely as "Human Nature" coexists comfortably with the tough, scared "Beat It," the sweet schmaltz of the Paul McCartney duet "The Girl Is Mine," and the frizzy funk of "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)." And, although this is an undeniably fun record, the paranoia is already creeping in, manifesting itself in the record\'s two best songs: "Billie Jean," where a woman claims Michael is the father of her child, and the delirious "Wanna Be Startin\' Something," the freshest funk on the album, but the most claustrophobic, scariest track Jackson ever recorded. These give the record its anchor and are part of the reason why the record is more than just a phenomenon. The other reason, of course, is that much of this is just simply great music.

          summary: 'Maroon 5 have certainly come a long way since their days in the indie outfit Kara\'s Flowers. After the band\'s demise in 1999, frontman Adam Levine surrounded himself with New York City\'s urban hip-hop culture and found a new musical calling. Maroon 5 was born and their debut album, Songs About Jane, illustrates an impressive rebirth. It\'s groovy in spots, offering bluesy funk on "Shiver" and a catchy, soulful disposition on "Harder to Breathe." "Must Get Out" slows things down with its dreamy lyrical story, and Levine is a vocal dead ringer for Men at Work\'s Colin Hay. Don\'t wince -- it works brilliantly. Songs About Jane is love-drunk on what makes Maroon 5 tick as a band. They\'re not as glossy as the Phantom Planet darlings; they\'ve got grit and a sexy strut, personally and musically. It\'s much too slick to cross over commercially in 2002, but it\'s good enough for the pop kids to take notice.

          summary: 'If Definitely Maybe was an unintentional concept album about wanting to be a rock & roll star, (What\'s the Story) Morning Glory? is what happens after the dreams come true. Oasis turns in a relatively introspective second record, filled with big, gorgeous ballads instead of ripping rockers. Unlike Definitely Maybe, the production on Morning Glory is varied enough to handle the range in emotions; instead of drowning everything with amplifiers turned up to 12, there are strings, keyboards, and harmonicas. This expanded production helps give Noel Gallagher\'s sweeping melodies an emotional resonance that he occasionally can\'t convey lyrically. However, that is far from a fatal flaw; Gallagher\'s lyrics work best in fragments, where the images catch in your mind and grow, thanks to the music. Gallagher may be guilty of some borrowing, or even plagiarism, but he uses the familiar riffs as building blocks. This is where his genius lies: He\'s a thief and doesn\'t have many original thoughts, but as a pop/rock melodicist he\'s pretty much without peer. Likewise, as musicians, Oasis are hardly innovators, yet they have a majestic grandeur in their sound that makes ballads like "Wonderwall" or rockers like "Some Might Say" positively transcendent. Alan White does add authority to the rhythm section, but the most noticeable change is in Liam Gallagher. His voice sneered throughout Definitely Maybe, but on Morning Glory his singing has become more textured and skillful. He gives the lyric in the raging title track a hint of regret, is sympathetic on "Wonderwall," defiant on "Some Might Say," and humorous on "She\'s Electric," a bawdy rewrite of "Digsy\'s Diner." It might not have the immediate impact of Definitely Maybe, but Morning Glory is just as exciting and compulsively listenable.

          summary: 'If Day at the Races was a sleek, streamlined album, its 1977 successor, News of the World, was its polar opposite, an explosion of styles that didn\'t seem to hold to any particular center. It\'s front-loaded with two of Queen\'s biggest anthems -- the stomping, stadium-filling chant "We Will Rock You" and its triumphant companion, "We Are the Champions" -- which are quickly followed by the ferocious "Sheer Heart Attack," a frenzied rocker that hits harder than anything on the album that shares its name (a remarkable achievement in itself). Three songs, three quick shifts in mood, but that\'s hardly the end of it. As the News rolls on, you\'re treated to the arch, campy crooning of "My Melancholy Blues," a shticky blues shuffle in "Sleeping on the Sidewalk," and breezy Latin rhythms on "Who Needs You." Then there\'s the neo-disco of "Fight from the Inside," which is eclipsed by the mechanical funk of "Get Down, Make Love," a dirty grind that\'s stripped of sensuality. That cold streak on "Get Down, Make Love" runs through the album as a whole. Despite the explosion of sounds and rhythms, this album doesn\'t add up to party thanks to that slightly distancing chilly vibe that hangs over the album. Nevertheless, many of these songs work well on their own as entities, so there is plenty to savor here, especially from Brian May. Whether he\'s doing the strangely subdued eccentric English pop "All Dead, All Dead" or especially the majestic yet nimble rocker "It\'s Late," he turns in work that gives this album some lightness, which it needs. And that\'s the reason News of the World was a monster hit despite its coldness -- when it works, it\'s massive, earth-shaking rock & roll, the sound of a band beginning to revel in its superstardom. [A 1994 digital version added a bonus mix of "We Will Rock You."] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

          summary: 'The Rolling Stones finally delivered a set of all-original material with Aftermath, which also did much to define the group as the bad boys of rock & roll, with their sneering attitude toward the world in general and the female sex in particular. The borderline misogyny could get a bit juvenile in tunes like "Stupid Girl." But on the other hand the group began incorporating the influences of psychedelia and Dylan into their material with classics like "Paint It, Black," an eerily insistent number one hit graced by some of the best use of sitar (played by Brian Jones) on a rock record. Other classics included the jazzy "Under My Thumb," where Jones added exotic accents with his vibes, and the delicate Elizabethan ballad "Lady Jane," where dulcimer can be heard. Some of the material is fairly ho-hum, to be honest, as Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were still prone to inconsistent songwriting; "Goin\' Home," an 11-minute blues jam, was remarkable, more for its barrier-crashing length than its content. Look out for an obscure gem, however, in the brooding, meditative "I Am Waiting." [This is the Japanese edition of the CD.] ~ Richie Unterberger',

          summary: 'Mostly recorded without Brian Jones -- who died several months before its release (although he does play on two tracks) and was replaced by Mick Taylor (who also plays on just two songs) -- Let It Bleed extends the rock and blues feel of Beggars Banquet into slightly harder-rocking, more demonically sexual territory. The Rolling Stones were never as consistent on album as their main rivals, the Beatles, and Let It Bleed suffers from some rather perfunctory tracks, like "Monkey Man" and a countrified remake of the classic "Honky Tonk Woman" (here titled "Country Honk"). Yet some of the songs are among their very best, especially "Gimme Shelter," with its shimmering guitar lines and apocalyptic lyrics; the harmonica-driven "Midnight Rambler"; the druggy party ambience of the title track; and the stunning "You Can\'t Always Get What You Want," which was the Stones\' "Hey Jude" of sorts, with its epic structure, horns, philosophical lyrics, and swelling choral vocals. "You Got the Silver" (Keith Richards\' first lead vocal) and Robert Johnson\'s "Love in Vain," by contrast, were as close to the roots of acoustic down-home blues as the Stones ever got. ~ Richie Unterberger',

          summary: 'The anthemic indie rock sound of Snow Patrol provides a bit of hope and promise among the many acts attempting to fit into a certain genre or scene. Snow Patrol belongs to their own scene, and their third album, 2004\'s Final Straw, proved that with several global hit singles such as "Run," "Chocolate," "How to Be Dead," and the reissue of "Spitting Games." British fans once more proclaimed their beloved Snow Patrol as a true rock & roll band while American audiences finally took notice of the Scottish collective. The band\'s fourth album, Eyes Open, doesn\'t fall short from where they left off; in fact, Snow Patrol\'s hungry rock sound only gets bigger and better this time around. All guitar hooks and singalong choruses are firmly in place. Gary Lightbody is an underrated frontman. On Eyes Open, he once again writes songs that are from the heart and true to self-reflection without getting too sappy and too overjoyed. From the playful name-dropping of Sufjan Stevens on "Hands Open" to their passionate delivery on "It\'s Beginning to Get to Me" and "Shut Your Eyes," Snow Patrol\'s approach is epic. They are the kind of band that embraces simplicity as beautiful and human flaws as art. The lullaby-like "You Could Be Happy" and the passionate buildup of "Make This Go on Forever" are evident of that. This 11-song set is a masterpiece, so keep your ears and eyes open for Snow Patrol. They\'re onto something big. ~ MacKenzie Wilson',

          summary: 'The Strokes sound like they have a lot to prove on Room on Fire, not to their naysayers, but to themselves. From the sneakily addictive, new wave-tinged "12:51" to "Automatic Stop"\'s loping reggae beat to "Under Control"\'s \'60s soul homage, the band explores sounds never dreamed of on their debut. Though the Strokes recapture some of Is This It\'s exuberance on "You Talk Way Too Much" and "Meet Me in the Bathroom," songs like "The End Has No End," which repeats its title in a surprisingly affecting way, are the most memorable. Room on Fire shows that even after all that happened to the Strokes, they can still surprise. ~ Heather Phares',

Released by the Friday Music label in 2013, it replaces Wounded Bird\'s 2006 reissue of Chic (1977) and Atlantic\'s 1992 CD edition of C\'est Chic (1978). Between the two albums, there\'s a fair amount of excellent material not featured on The Very Best of Chic, such as "São Paulo" (a breezy instrumental), "Chic Cheer" (more than a mere mood setter for the second album), and "At Last I Am Free" (a gorgeous quiet storm gem covered by Robert Wyatt). ~ Andy Kellman',

            summary: 'Stereo Rodeo is Rusted Root\'s first studio album in seven years -- a long stretch of time by any measure but especially long for a group who at its heart is a working band, earning its audience by constant performances. Constant performances should lead to regular recordings, but not for Rusted Root in the new millennium, who released not a single collection of new material since the attempted pop crossover of 2002\'s Welcome to My Party. Stereo Rodeo has elements of that shiny gloss, but there\'s a heavy emphasis on their elastic worldbeat grooves which, more than ever, seem indebted to latter-day Talking Heads, only minus the esoteric egghead bent. Rusted Root still lean toward crowd-pleasing jams -- clearly evident on their slow take of Elvis\' "Suspicious Minds," but also on their lengthy groove-oriented cuts where mood supersedes hooks, something that is a bit of a Rusted Root trademark. So in that sense, Stereo Rodeo could be seen as a correction or a tacit apology for the pop inclinations of Welcome to My Party, a way to get the band back to their roots without drawing attention to any machinations that get them there. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

            summary: 'When Alex Ebert re-emerged in 2009 as messianic musical cult leader Edward Sharpe, many familiar with his previous band, Ima Robot, weren\'t buying it. With Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros, Ebert made the dramatic 180 from sleazy electroclash-leaning punk singer to grizzly bearded bandleader in an 11-piece down-home freak folk revue, bright psychedelic colors and farmhouse harmonies replacing his not too distant past of black leather and smirky sneers. Artists change constantly, and Ebert\'s reinvention wasn\'t completely laughable or phony. While mired with some cringe-inducing Jim Morrison aping and a generally cluttered sense of arrangement, the band\'s debut album, Up from Below, had some bright moments when the strength of the songwriting cut through the affectation and actually seemed genuine in a roundabout way. A few years later, Here is much the same. The bandmembers wear the whole communal free-living throwback hippie jamboree persona to the point where they dip into goofy character sketches and threaten to detract completely from some pretty catchy songs. The album opens strongly, with the undeniably catchy pair of tunes "Man on Fire" and "That\'s What\'s Up," both rising to handclapping summits of old-fashioned Southern revival and jug band jubilation. The hooky choruses are solid, but there\'s a pretty heavy sense of musical theater throughout these highlights, leaving the Magnetic Zeros coming off more like Jesus Christ Superstar meets Emit Otter\'s Jug Band Christmas than the freak folk hoedown they were aiming for. Lead vocalist Jade Castrinos reprises her role trading verses with Ebert on these songs and later takes center stage on the electrified "Fiya Wata." Castrinos\' contributions feel spirited and from the gut, whether they\'re put on or not. Following a strong start, the album fades into a series of exercises in style or emulation. Washy group vocal slow-burner "Mayla" is an acid-soaked sunshine daydream of little substance complete with Jerry Garcia-styled guitar noodling throughout. "One Love to Another" is a striking exhibit of a Bob Marley ripoff, a daring move in even the most fried acid rock circles. While the string of affectations and re-creations of various sects of hippie culture aren\'t completely unenjoyable, they get old really fast, especially on the weaker material. Ebert\'s intentions and previous bands are really immaterial in the case of Here. The album comes up short in the song department and doesn\'t quite get by on its abundance of free-love signifiers. [Here was also released on LP.] ~ Fred Thomas',

            summary: 'Nothing truly prepares anyone for the loss of a parent. No matter how aware one may be about the realities of disease and death, no matter what their attitude about their mother or father, experiencing the passing of the person who brought them into this world hits hard and deep, and the survivors are left to come to terms with their pain in their own ways. Sufjan Stevens is a songwriter and a musician, so it should come as no surprise that in the wake of the death of his mother Carrie in 2012, his grief took the form of a collection of songs. But 2015\'s Carrie & Lowell is not a simple homage to Stevens\' mother and stepfather. Stevens had a difficult relationship with his mother that would defy a simple farewell; she left his father when Stevens was just a year old, and she was a random presence throughout much of his childhood. While there\'s deep and genuine love in Carrie & Lowell, there\'s also uncertainty, sadness, and brief but jagged bursts of anger; these songs speak of loss and heartache and the difficult push and pull of familial relationships, but they\'re also full of random memories, both pleasant and troubling, and they leap from reveries of family vacations faded by the passing of decades, to the immediate regrets of what was or wasn\'t said and done in the aftermath of death. Carrie & Lowell is about memory as much as mourning, and Stevens has drawn these songs in a purposefully elegant manner, with his introspection accompanied by beautiful but homespun melodies, and the arrangements and production only magnifying their dreamlike, whisper-quiet drift that strikes with an emotional force that a louder, more violent approach could not achieve. Carrie & Lowell is a heartfelt expression of love that is devoid of the slightest hint of sentimentality, and with these songs, Stevens strips his emotions bare and allows us all to be the audience for his anger, shame, and sense of loss as he pages through his memories of his family. Carrie & Lowell is the most harrowingly personal work Stevens has offered us to date; it also ranks with his most skillfully crafted albums despite its spartan approach, and it\'s a sometimes difficult but profoundly moving work. Stevens has offered us some fine albums in the past, but he\'s never made anything quite like Carrie & Lowell. ~ Mark Deming',

            summary: 'Guitarist Ryley Walker follows All Kinds of You, his 2014 debut full-length, by delving deeper into some of the abstract jazz and psych-inflected folk-rock that permeated several of its tracks. On Primrose Green -- his debut for Dead Oceans -- he doesn\'t worry about putting his own signature on his tunes; this record is all about playing music he loves with people he respects. Though these are original songs, their inspirational roots lie in late-\'60s and early-\'70s sources. He\'s found a host of willing Chicago collaborators from the worlds of jazz and improv to assist, including cellists Fred Lonberg-Holm and Whitney Johnson, vibraphonist Jason Adasiewicz, drummer Frank Rosaly, keyboardist Ben Boye, upright and electric bassist Anton Hatwich, and electric guitarist Brian Sulpizio. Less than a minute into the opening title track, one can hear the very spirit of Tim Buckley -- one of several Walker muses here -- coming through the ether (or smoke, such as it were, since it is titled for a particular strain of pot). Eastern modes and droning psych are rung out on a 12-string, piano, electric guitars, vibes, and upright bass (the latter recalling Danny Thompson, who played with Buckley on the London concert issued as Dream Letter). Walker\'s voice swoops and sails, floats and hovers through his words about getting high. "Summer Dress" moves on (a bit) to widen the circle and embrace John Martyn\'s early-\'70s sound inside Buckley\'s elastic chamber jazz approach. Sulpizio\'s guitar and Adasiewicz\'s vibes send this one into a darkly grooving stratosphere. "Same Minds" is so silvery and mercurial, one can feel Martyn\'s ghost in the mix. The instrumental "Love Can Be Cruel" evokes Brian Auger\'s sense of space and motion with wafting electronic noise grounding the tune in the 21st century. Speaking of Auger, the twilit psych-jazz of "Sweet Satisfaction" recalls the keyboardist\'s Trinity band with singer Julie Driscoll (now Tippetts), though Buckley\'s sense of elongated glossolalia still holds sway over the singer\'s vocal. Walker\'s killer fingerstyle guitar artistry isn\'t left off this record; it\'s present to stellar effect on "Griffiths Bucks Blues," "On the Banks of the Old Kishwaukee," "The High Road" (a duet with Lonberg-Holm), and the closing "Hide in the Roses." The latter track is informed by Bert Jansch\'s and Davy Graham\'s readings of the British Isles folk tradition. It\'s these rootsier tunes that add glue to the sensual, stoned, free-spirited cuts to make this a cohesive album. With its ready absorption of, homage to, and engagement with the past, Walker\'s skills as a guitarist and arranger make Primrose Green as musically compelling as it is willfully indulgent. ~ Thom Jurek',

            summary: 'The artificial synth-horn tones and repurposed Prince beat that begin "Shapeless," the first song on Nashville-via-Brooklyn band Wild Cub\'s debut album Youth, would seem to set the tone for an album of updated \'80s synth pop viewed through an indie lens. This is at least partially true, as there\'s an \'80s reference point on almost each of this lengthy album\'s 15 tracks. Principle singer/songwriter Keegan DeWitt\'s vocals draw on Peter Gabriel, Bowie, and even some Achtung Baby-era Bono-isms on the swimmy downer ballad "Drive." New Order-seeped guitar melodies, John Hughes soundtrack nostalgia, and bouncy retro-electro rhythms also funnel into the heavy \'80s influence, but apart from these familiar elements, DeWitt and his multi-instrumentalist partner Jeremy Bullock manage to take each track into unexpected places without losing the overall thread. Individually, every song seems to be exploring a wildly different territory than the others, evidenced in the disparity between the cheesy guitar noodling and Phil Collins reimagining of "Hidden in the Night" and the bounding, feel-good clarity of songs like "Windows," "Wild Light," or the shamelessly romantic and endlessly catchy "Thunder Clap." Similarly "Straight No Turns" is built around a dancy beat so hypnotic it almost becomes a club track on its extended fade-out, but blurs into almost ambient dreaminess a few songs later on the decidedly more organic tune "The Water." While each song seems to be trying on dramatically different ideas and styles, they all gel when taken as a whole. DeWitt\'s melodies seem to cycle and repeat throughout the album, giving cohesion to the songs as they amble between direct pop hooks and aimless experimenting. Themes of burning, youthful love and its uncontrollable urgency come through louder than any production choice on Youth. Similar to the cloudy nostalgia of M83 or the melodramatic yet heartfelt howling of the Arcade Fire at their most sincere, Wild Cub taps into a specific emotional thread and rides it throughout every single song here. While certain songs definitely stand on their own, the ability to capture a feeling throughout is what makes the album memorable and worthy of repeat listening. ~ Fred Thomas',

            summary: 'There has rarely been a shortage of musical talent emerging from Iceland, an island that is cast away in the northern echelons of the Atlantic Ocean, but which is rich in cultural and artistic talents, with the likes of Björk and Sigur Rós dominating their respective genres across the world. Icelandic tastemakers have also hoisted Ásgeir Trausti\'s debut album to the number one spot in the charts, a record which additionally scooped top accolades in the 2012 Icelandic Music Awards. Originally released as Dýrð í Dauðaþögn in his homeland, Ásgeir enlisted the help of John Grant to translate the record into English for this international release, and renamed it In the Silence. The melodic indie folk that Ásgeir incorporates here is poised intriguingly between acoustic instruments and electronic elements, and single the "King and Cross" expertly brings the two together in a charming slice of indie pop. The decision to translate the lyrics was wise and subsequently offers a more wide-spread accessibility to his songs that might not have been possible in his native tongue. Ásgeir and Grant have woven together whimsical tales and stories from the original Icelandic text without many obvious adjustments from the original melodies. Although upbeat for the most part -- "Torrent" and "In Harmony" are particular highlights -- there is a constant hint of melancholy that resides in the beauty of Ásgeir\'s high-pitched and unnervingly emotive vocals, which is brought out in the more brooding moments of the record. The downbeat and bass-driven "Going Home" uncovers an expansive and pensive side of Ásgeir, which is a welcome contrast to the initial sweetness, and at times tweeness, of his melodies and harmonies. Although it\'s unlikely In the Silence will have quite the same impact on the charts beyond the shores of Iceland, it does suggest another musical gem has been unearthed from the island\'s formidable pool of talent. ~ Scott Kerr',

            summary: 'Brandon Flowers\' solo debut, 2010\'s Flamingo, seemed to make the case that the line between a Killers album and a Flowers album was blurry at best. Largely a continuation of the anthemic Springsteen-influenced sound of the Killers\' 2006 effort Sam\'s Town, Flamingo also revealed Flowers\' inclination toward glossy, synth-heavy, \'80s adult-contemporary productions. For his sophomore solo outing, 2015\'s The Desired Effect, the line between the man and his band begins to sharpen. Produced by Ariel Rechtshaid (Madonna, Vampire Weekend, HAIM), the album finally finds Flowers achieving an unmistakable sound of his own, with the kind of effortless sophistication that a seasoned musician hopes for. Flowers long ago expanded his musical palette from the Killers\' early, Duran Duran-influenced brand of dance-rock, but he\'s also become much more adept at combining his disparate musical influences and poetic narratives into a cohesive, emotionally resonant approach to expansive pop songwriting. As always, these are catchy, synth heavy songs punctuated by twangy guitar lines and Flowers\' trademark lyrical themes, including: emotional turning points in long term relationships, lost souls seeking redemption, and of course, his childhood growing up in Vegas—which is particularly evident on the fittingly titled "Way It\'s Always Been." He sings, "They shut down the Golden Sahara Hotel/ Jessica says it won\'t be long til they blow it all to hell/ She\'s standing in the front yard, cut-offs and skin/ Me and her brother we been friends, since I can\'t remember when/ Ain\'t that the way that it\'s always been?/ Everybody sitting \'round waiting for the son to come again." Elsewhere, Flowers launches into an \'80s take on Spector-style wall-of-synth-sound on "Dreams Come True," and mashes up John Fogerty, ELO and Dire Straits on the Roy Orbison-style rock & roll number "Digging Up the Heart." The genius thing about all this is that Flowers doesn\'t steal Jeff Lynne\'s hooks or ape Mark Knopfler\'s guitar sound (well, not exactly), he just imbues his productions with a distinct level of tangible homage. In fact, he\'s so specific in his aural fixations that you can almost pick out the songs he was listening to when working on a given track. On "Can\'t Deny My Love," you can almost picture him starting out with the Latin synth-percussion from Madonna\'s "La Isla Bonita," then bringing in the brittle guitar of Bryan Ferry\'s "Don\'t Stop the Dance," before finally punching up the transitions with the percussive synth beats from Neneh Cherry\'s "Buffalo Stance." And this isn\'t meant to make Flowers sound derivative. On the contrary, these points of inspiration exist in a sea of original material. Flowers even brings on board a handful of special guests, like Pet Shop Boys\' Neil Tennant, on the Giorgio Moroder-esque disco tune "I Can Change," and Bruce Hornsby on the earnest ballad "Between Me and You." These choices work to underline the stylistic touchstones on the album. They also undercut any accusations of derivativeness by openly acknowledging his progenitors. And in the end, we\'re lucky he was so inspired by them, if the result is an album this solid. ~ Matt Collar',

            summary: 'Perhaps the success of "Float On" discombobulated Isaac Brock even more than we suspected. Surely, there were signs of aimlessness on We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank, the 2007 sequel to the surprise 2004 smash Good News for People Who Love Bad News, a record where hired gun Johnny Marr was brought aboard to give the band a jolt. This booster shot wore off quickly and Brock receded from the spotlight, sitting out the better part of a decade before re-emerging with Strangers to Ourselves in the spring of 2015. In the interim, he shed longterm collaborator Eric Judy -- he left sometime around 2012, replaced by Russell Higbee -- added guitarist Jim Fairchild and auxiliary player Lisa Molinaro, attempted to record an album with Big Boi, toyed with bringing Krist Novoselic aboard, then finally decided to get back to where he once belonged. Brock\'s return to roots is naturally a roundabout of detours, a record that bounces between stylized eccentricity and streamlined strangeness, stopping occasionally to soak in a scenic, dreamy view. Strangers to Ourselves starts at this hazy point, swooning with a narcotic sway that recalls peak Mercury Rev, but it\'s not long before Modest Mouse begins bouncing at a syncopation that recalls "Float On," just one of many deliberate references to the ghosts of alt-rock past haunting Strangers to Ourselves. "Pistol" skeeves out like a disco-fied outtake from Ween\'s Pure Guava, the carnivalesque "Sugar Boats" lurches forward on a circus piano reminiscent of Blur, "The Best Room" circles around a guitar riff that echoes Space Ghost Coast to Coast, each a signal that Brock is comfortable keeping the dream of the \'90s. The trick is, he now has the skill of a consummate craftsman, so the raggedness here comes across as deliberate, probably because the moments that are less consciously quirky -- i.e., the bulk of the album -- are so skillfully constructed. So, Strangers to Ourselves is an album where the trees matter more than the forest: song for song, it demonstrates the exacting nature of Brock but put it all together, it sprawls. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

            summary: 'Compared to Jamie xx\'s impact on music, it\'s easy to forget that he hasn\'t released much on his own. The distinctive yet surprisingly versatile blend of indie, R&B, and dance in his work with the xx, Gil Scott-Heron, and his remixes helped shape the sound of the late 2000s and 2010s, but his solo discography was limited to a handful of singles, many of which appear on his first full-length, In Colour. While one of his best singles, "All Under One Roof Raving," doesn\'t appear on the album, its balance of the kinetic and the atmospheric -- as well as its reverence for classic U.K. dance music -- is reflected on some of In Colour\'s brightest highlights. "Gosh" is hard-edged yet radiant, its juddering drum\'n\'bass rhythms and shouted samples adding heft and movement before swelling synths overtake the track like a sunrise after a long night out. Indeed, for most of the album, Jamie xx uses his considerable gifts for atmosphere to make listeners remember the euphoria of dance music rather than immerse them in it. Despite its brassy flourishes, "Girl"\'s filtered house is haunting and aloof instead of driving, while its former B-side "Sleep Sound" fades in and out like a dream. Given his skills as a collaborator, it\'s not surprising that some of In Colour\'s best moments occur when he shares the spotlight. While his reunion with xx bandmate Oliver Sim on the implosive "Stranger in a Room" is almost too reminiscent of their previous work, Romy Madley Croft remains one of his most inspiring muses. She gives In Colour\'s nostalgia more humanity on the beautifully blurred "Seesaw" and "Loud Places," where a sample of Idris Muhammad\'s joyous "Could Heaven Ever Be Like This" makes the contrast between then and now, and alone and together, all the more poignant. However, the album\'s most immediate moment belongs to Young Thug and Popcaan. Inspired by a drive from Manhattan to Brooklyn while listening to Hot 97, the summery "I Know There\'s Gonna Be (Good Times)" embraces pop, hip-hop, and dancehall in a way that feels evocative and forward-looking. As it moves from reflective to engaging and back again, In Colour covers the entire spectrum of Jamie xx\'s music, delivering flashes of brilliance along the way. [In Colour was also released on LP.] ~ Heather Phares',

            summary: 'To call OutKast\'s follow-up to their 2000 masterpiece Stankonia the most eagerly awaited hip-hop album of the new millennium may be hyperbole, but not by much. In its kaleidoscopic, deep-fried amalgam of Dirty South, dirty funk, techno, and psychedelia, Stankonia was fearlessly exploratory and giddy with possibilities. It was hard to imagine where the duo was going to go next, but one possibility that few entertained was that Big Boi and Andre 3000 would split apart, each recording an album on his own and then releasing the pair as the fifth OutKast album, Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, in the fall of 2003. Although both albums have their own distinct character, the effect is kind of like if the Beatles issued The White Album as one LP of Lennon tunes, the other of McCartney songs -- the individual records may be more coherent, but the illusion that the group can do anything is tarnished. By isolating themselves from each other, Big Boi and Andre 3000 diminish the idea of OutKast slightly, since the focus is on the individuals, not the group. Which, of course, is part of the point of releasing solo albums under the group name -- it\'s to prove that the two can exist under the umbrella of the OutKast aesthetic while standing as individuals. Thing is, while it would have been a wild, bracing listen to hear these 39 songs mixed up, alternating between Boi and Dre cuts, the two albums do prove that the music can be solo in execution but remain OutKast records through and through. Both records are visionary, imaginative listens, providing some of the best music of 2003, regardless of genre. If conventional wisdom, based on their public personas and previous music, held that Big Boi\'s record, Speakerboxxx, would be the more conventional of the two and Andre 3000\'s The Love Below the more experimental, that doesn\'t turn out to be quite true. From the moment Speakerboxxx kicks into gear with "GhettoMusick" and its relentless blend of old-school 808s and breakneck breakbeats, it\'s clear that Boi is ignoring boundaries, and the rest of his album follows suit. It\'s grounded firmly within hip-hop, but the beats bend against the grain and the arrangements are overflowing with ideas and thrilling, unpredictable juxtapositions, such as how "Bowtie" swings like big-band jazz filtered through George Clinton, how "The Way You Move" offsets its hard-driving verses with seductive choruses, or how "The Rooster" cheerfully rides a threatening minor-key mariachi groove, salted by slippery horns and loose-limbed wah-wah guitars. It\'s a hell of a ride, reclaiming the adventurous spirit of the golden age and pushing it into a new era.  By contrast, The Love Below isn\'t so much visionary as it is unapologetically eccentric. And as the cocktail jazz pianos that sparkle through the first few songs indicate, it\'s not much of a hip-hop album. Instead, Andre 3000 has created the great lost Prince album -- the platter that the Purple One recorded somewhere between Around the World in a Day and Sign \'o\' the Times. It\'s not just that the music and song titles cheekily recall Prince -- "She Lives in My Lap" is a close relation of the B-side "She\'s Always in My Hair" -- it\'s that Dre disregards any rules on a quest to create his own interior world, right down to a dialogue with God. The difference between Andre 3000 and Prince is in that dialogue, too: Prince was tortured; Andre is trying to get laid. That cheerfully randy spirit surges through The Love Below, even on the spooky-serious closer, "A Life in the Day of Benjamin Andre," and it gives Andre the freedom to try a little of everything, from mock crooning on "Love Haters" to a breakbeat jazz interpretation of "My Favorite Things" to the strange one-man funk of "Roses" and the incandescent "Hey Ya!," where classic soul and electro-funk coexist happily. So, both records are very different, but the remarkable thing is, they both feel thoroughly like OutKast music. Big Boi and Andre 3000 took off in different directions from the same starting point, yet they wind up sounding unified because they share the same freewheeling aesthetic, where everything is alive and everything is possible within their music. That spirit fuels not just the best hip-hop, but the best pop music, and both Speakerboxxx and The Love Below are among the best hip-hop and best pop music released this decade. Each is a knockout individually, and paired together, their force is undeniable. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

The album spawned a pair of somewhat forgettable remix EPs and was reissued by TVT immediately upon release. ~ Sean Cooper',

Once again working with executive producer Alex Da Kid (Imagine Dragons, Nicki Minaj, Eminem), VHS follows up the group\'s previous Alex Da Kid-produced EPs, including 2013\'s Love Songs Drug Songs and 2014\'s The Reason. As with those releases, VHS showcases the talents of lead singer/songwriter Sam Harris, keyboardist Casey Harris, and guitarist Noah Feldsuh. Featured on VHS are several guest collaborations, including the previously released "Jungle" with Jamie N Commons and "Fear" with Imagine Dragons. Also included on VHS is the hit single "Renegades." ~ Matt Collar',

            summary: 'James Taylor never sets his guitar down -- he spends a good portion of every year satisfying faithful audiences -- but he did rest his pen, opting to sit out the 13 years following the release of 2002\'s October Road. He kept busy with covers albums and Christmas records, but Before This World finds Taylor returning to writing, a habit he abandoned about a decade prior. Often, Before This World contains echoes of the first decade of the new millennium -- there is a passing reference to 9/11 in a song about Afghanistan and a love letter to the Boston Red Sox\'s 2004 World Series win -- but Taylor wrote these all in a batch, then recorded them at home with his touring band. Such quick progress gives the record a cozy, unified feeling but, unlike some latter-day JT records, it\'s not too comfortable. Taylor is randy enough to sing about some "first-class poontang" on the nicely grooving "Stretch of the Highway," a song more notable for a mellow vamp worthy of Steely Dan, the first suggestion there\'s a bit more variety here than on a typical Taylor platter. He\'ll ease into his trademark laid-back pop, opening the proceedings with "Today Today Today" and brightening up the midsection with the happy "Watchin\' Over Me," but as the record comes toward its conclusion, he takes detours into traditional English folk on "Before This World/Jolly Springtime" and "Wild Mountain Thyme," while etching out a cinematic protest song in "Far Afghanistan." When a record runs only ten tracks and 41 minutes, these departures amount to nearly half the record and turn Before This World into something unexpected: a record as relaxed as the average James Taylor album but one that\'s also riskier and richer, the right album for him to make at this date. [Before This World was also released on LP.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

            summary: 'James Taylor had scored eight Top 40 hits by the fall of 1976 when Warner Brothers marked the end of his contract with this compilation. One of those hits, the Top Ten gold single "Mockingbird," a duet with his wife Carly Simon, was on Elektra Records, part of the Warner family of labels and presumably available, but it was left off. "Long Ago and Far Away," a lesser hit (though it made the Top Ten on the easy listening charts), wasn\'t used either. In addition to the six hits -- "Fire and Rain," "Country Road," "You\'ve Got a Friend," "Don\'t Let Me Be Lonely Tonight," "How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)," and "Shower the People" -- that were included, the album featured a couple of less successful singles, "Mexico" and "Walking Man," the album track "Sweet Baby James," and three previously unreleased recordings -- a live version of "Steamroller" and newly recorded versions of "Something in the Way She Moves" and "Carolina in My Mind," songs featured on Taylor\'s 1968 debut album, recorded for Apple/Capitol. The result was a reasonable collection for an artist who wasn\'t particularly well-defined by his singles. One got little sense of Taylor\'s evolution from the dour, confessional songs of his first two albums to the more conventional pop songs of his sixth and seventh ones. But one did hear isolated examples of Taylor\'s undeniable warmth and facility for folk/country-tinged pop. By the next summer, Taylor was back in the Top Ten on Columbia, and Greatest Hits was out of date. But it remains a good sampler of Taylor\'s more popular early work. [Greatest Hits was re-released on LP in 215.] ~ William Ruhlmann',

            summary: 'Al Stewart had found his voice on Past, Present & Future and found his sound on Modern Times. He then perfected it all on 1976\'s Year of the Cat, arguably his masterpiece. There is no overarching theme here, as there was on its two immediate predecessors, but the impossible lushness of Alan Parsons\' production and Stewart\'s evocative Continental narratives give the record a welcome feeling of cohesion that keeps the record enchanting as it moves from "Lord Grenville" to "Midas Shadow" to "Broadway Hotel," before it ends with the haunting title track. Along the way, Stewart doesn\'t dwell too deeply in any area, preferring to trace out mysteries with his evocative lyrical imagery and a spinning array of self-consciously sophisticated music, songs that evoke American and European folk and pop with a deliberate grace. This could be unbearably precious if it didn\'t work so well. Stewart is detached from his music, but only in the sense that he gives this album a stylish elegance, and Parsons is his perfect foil, giving the music a rich, panoramic sweep that mimics Stewart\'s globe-trotting songs. The result is a tremendous example of how good self-conscious progressive pop can be, given the right producer and songwriter -- and if you\'re a fan of either prog or pop and haven\'t given Al Stewart much thought, prepare to be enchanted. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

            summary: 'Weighing in at 15 CDs, The Studio Albums 1969-1983 is a hefty box set but, at $85, it is relatively affordable considering that it contains everything Alice Cooper -- both the band and the man -- recorded at Straight and Warner. Whatever bonus material attached to CD reissues over the years has been stripped away -- nothing from the 2001 deluxe edition of Billion Dollar Babies, then -- and there are no new remasters of the albums, but this set isn\'t bare bones. The mini-LP replicas contain a few inserts carried over from the vinyl and, more importantly, those early Straight Records are present, which is good because they were out of print for a while. Not everything here is great  -- he did have a rough patch in the late \'70s and early \'80s -- but it\'s all interesting, and it\'s especially nice to be able to get the entire catalog so easily and cheaply. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

            summary: 'The Cars\' 1978 self-titled debut, issued on the Elektra label, is a genuine rock masterpiece. The band jokingly referred to the album as their "true greatest-hits album," but it\'s no exaggeration -- all nine tracks are new wave/rock classics, still in rotation on rock radio. Whereas most bands of the late \'70s embraced either punk/new wave or hard rock, the Cars were one of the first bands to do the unthinkable -- merge the two styles together. Add to it bandleader/songwriter Ric Ocasek\'s supreme pop sensibilities, and you had an album that appealed to new wavers, rockers, and Top 40 fans. One of the most popular new wave songs ever, "Just What I Needed," is an obvious highlight, as are such familiar hits as "Good Times Roll," "My Best Friend\'s Girl," and "You\'re All I\'ve Got Tonight." But like most consummate rock albums, the lesser-known compositions are just as exhilarating: "Don\'t Cha Stop," "Bye Bye Love," "All Mixed Up," and "Moving in Stereo," the latter featured as an instrumental during a steamy scene in the popular movie Fast Times at Ridgemont High. With flawless performances, songwriting, and production (courtesy of Queen alumni Roy Thomas Baker), the Cars\' debut remains one of rock\'s all-time classics. [The Cars was re-released on LP in 2106.] ~ Greg Prato',

            summary: 'The Doobie Brothers\' third long-player was the charm, their most substantial and consistent album to date, and one that rode the charts for a year. It was also a study in contrasts, Tom Johnston\'s harder-edged, bolder rocking numbers balanced by Patrick Simmons\' more laid-back country-rock ballad style. The leadoff track, Johnston\'s "Natural Thing," melded the two, opening with interlocking guitars and showcasing the band\'s exquisite soaring harmonies around a beautiful melody, all wrapped up in a midtempo beat -- the result was somewhere midway between Allman Brothers-style virtuosity and Eagles/Crosby & Nash-type lyricism, which defined this period in the Doobies\' history and gave them a well-deserved lock on the top of the charts. Next up was the punchy, catchy "Long Train Runnin\'," a piece they\'d been playing for years as an instrumental -- a reluctant Johnston was persuaded by producer Ted Templeman to write lyrics to it and record the song, and the resulting track became the group\'s next hit. The slashing, fast-tempo "China Grove" and "Without You" represented the harder side of the Doobies\' sound, and were juxtaposed with Simmons\' romantic country-rock ballads "Clear as the Driven Snow," and "South City Midnight Lady." Simmons also showed off his louder side with "Evil Woman," while Johnston showed his more reflective side with "Dark Eyed Cajun Woman," "Ukiah" and "The Captain and Me" -- the latter, a soaring rocker clocking in at nearly five minutes, features radiant guitars and harmonies, soaring ever higher and faster to a triumphant finish. ~ Bruce Eder',

            summary: 'Following on the heels of an album where he repudiated his past with his greatest backing band, Blood on the Tracks finds Bob Dylan, in a way, retreating to the past, recording a largely quiet, acoustic-based album. But this is hardly nostalgia -- this is the sound of an artist returning to his strengths, what feels most familiar, as he accepts a traumatic situation, namely the breakdown of his marriage. This is an album alternately bitter, sorrowful, regretful, and peaceful, easily the closest he ever came to wearing his emotions on his sleeve. That\'s not to say that it\'s an explicitly confessional record, since many songs are riddles or allegories, yet the warmth of the music makes it feel that way. The original version of the album was even quieter -- first takes of "Idiot Wind" and "Tangled Up in Blue," available on The Bootleg Series, Vols. 1-3, are hushed and quiet (excised verses are quoted in the liner notes, but not heard on the record) -- but Blood on the Tracks remains an intimate, revealing affair since these harsher takes let his anger surface the way his sadness does elsewhere. As such, it\'s an affecting, unbearably poignant record, not because it\'s a glimpse into his soul, but because the songs are remarkably clear-eyed and sentimental, lovely and melancholy at once. And, in a way, it\'s best that he was backed with studio musicians here, since the professional, understated backing lets the songs and emotion stand at the forefront. Dylan made albums more influential than this, but he never made one better. [In 2003, Columbia/Legacy reissued 15 selected titles from Dylan\'s catalog as hybrid SACDs, playable in both regular CD players and Super Audio CD players. Each title is packaged as a digipak, containing the full original artwork. On each of the titles, and on each of the layers, the remastered sound is spectacular, a considerable upgrade from the initial CD pressings. Blood on the Tracks was one of five titles that also included a 5.1 Surround Sound mix.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

            summary: 'Peter Gabriel introduced his fifth studio album, So, with "Sledgehammer," an Otis Redding-inspired soul-pop raver that was easily his catchiest, happiest single to date. Needless to say, it was also his most accessible, and, in that sense it was a good introduction to So, the catchiest, happiest record he ever cut. "Sledgehammer" propelled the record toward blockbuster status, and Gabriel had enough songs with single potential to keep it there. There was "Big Time," another colorful dance number; "Don\'t Give Up," a moving duet with Kate Bush; "Red Rain," a stately anthem popular on album rock radio; and "In Your Eyes," Gabriel\'s greatest love song, which achieved genuine classic status after being featured in Cameron Crowe\'s classic Say Anything. These all illustrated the strengths of the album: Gabriel\'s increased melodicism and ability to blend African music, jangly pop, and soul into his moody art rock. Apart from these singles, plus the urgent "That Voice Again," the rest of the record is as quiet as the album tracks of Security. The difference is, the singles on that record were part of the overall fabric; here, the singles are the fabric, which can make the album seem top-heavy (a fault of many blockbuster albums, particularly those of the mid-\'80s). Even so, those songs are so strong, finding Gabriel in a newfound confidence and accessibility, that it\'s hard not to be won over by them, even if So doesn\'t develop the unity of its two predecessors.

            summary: `The leap from 1970's Benefit to the following year's Aqualung is one of the most astonishing progressions in rock history. In the space of one album, Tull went from relatively unassuming electrified folk-rock to larger-than-life conceptual rock full of sophisticated compositions and complex, intellectual, lyrical constructs. While the leap to full-blown prog rock wouldn't be taken until a year later on Thick as a Brick, the degree to which Tull upped the ante here is remarkable.␍␊
            The lyrical concept -- the hypocrisy of Christianity in England -- is stronger than on most other '70s conceptual efforts, but it's ultimately the music that makes it worthy of praise. Tull's winning way with a riff was never so arresting as on the chugging "Locomotive Breath," or on the character studies "Cross Eyed Mary" and "Aqualung," which portray believably seedy participants in Ian Anderson's story. The fable imagery of "Mother Goose" and the vitriolic anti-authoritarian sentiments of "Wind Up" both serve notice of Anderson's willful iconoclasm and his disillusionment with the spiritual traditions to which he was born. Varied but cohesive, Aqualung is widely regarded as Tull's finest hour. [Aqualung was released in a two-CD/two-DVD box set in 2016.] ~ Rovi Staff`,

            summary: 'Jethro Tull\'s first LP-length epic is a masterpiece in the annals of progressive rock, and one of the few works of its kind that still holds up decades later. Mixing hard rock and English folk music with classical influences, set to stream-of-consciousness lyrics so dense with imagery that one might spend weeks pondering their meaning -- assuming one feels the need to do so -- the group created a dazzling tour de force, at once playful, profound, and challenging, without overwhelming the listener. The original LP was the best-sounding, best-engineered record Tull had ever released, easily capturing the shifting dynamics between the soft all-acoustic passages and the electric rock crescendos surrounding them. ~ Bruce Eder',

            summary: 'War Child was Jethro Tull\'s first album after two chart-toppers, Thick as a Brick and A Passion Play, and was one of those records that was a hit the day it was announced (it was certified platinum based on pre-orders, the last Tull album to earn platinum record status). It never made the impression of its predecessors, however, as it was a return to standard-length songs following two epic-length pieces. It was inevitable that the material would lack power, if only because the opportunity for development that gave Thick as a Brick and A Passion Play some of their power. Additionally, the music was no longer quite able to cover for the obscurity of Tull\'s lyrics ("Two Fingers" being the best example). The title track is reasonably successful, but "Queen and Country" seems repetitive and pointless. "Ladies," by contrast, is one of Tull\'s folk-based pieces, and one of the prettiest songs on the record, beautifully sung and benefiting from some of Anderson\'s best flute playing to date. The band is very tight but doesn\'t really get to show its stuff until "Back-Door Angels," after which the album picks up. "Sealion" is one of Anderson\'s pseudo-philosophical musings on life, mixing full-out electric playing and restrained orchestral backing in a manner that recalls Thick as a Brick. "Skating Away on the Thin Ice of a New Day" is a beautiful, largely acoustic number that was popular in concert, but "Bungle in the Jungle," with a title that went over well, got most of the radio play. "The Third Hoorah" is really a follow-up to "War Child," and opens with one of the prettiest progressions on a folk tune in Tull\'s repertory, with some lovely harpsichord from John Evan evolving into a powerful rock number with a surprising orchestral break and what has to be the most successful appearance of bagpipes in a mainstream rock song.

            summary: 'Billy Joel teamed with Phil Ramone, a famed engineer who had just scored his first producing hits with Art Garfunkel\'s Breakaway and Paul Simon\'s Still Crazy After All These Years for The Stranger, his follow-up to Turnstiles. Joel still favored big, sweeping melodies, but Ramone convinced him to streamline his arrangements and clean up the production. The results aren\'t necessarily revelatory, since he covered so much ground on Turnstiles, but the commercialism of The Stranger is a bit of a surprise. None of his ballads have been as sweet or slick as "Just the Way You Are"; he never had created a rocker as bouncy or infectious as "Only the Good Die Young"; and the glossy production of "She\'s Always a Woman" disguises its latent misogynist streak. Joel balanced such radio-ready material with a series of New York vignettes, seemingly inspired by Springsteen\'s working-class fables and clearly intended to be the artistic centerpieces of the album. They do provide The Stranger with the feel of a concept album, yet there is no true thematic connection between the pieces, and his lyrics are often vague or mean-spirited. His lyrical shortcomings are overshadowed by his musical strengths. Even if his melodies sound more Broadway than Beatles -- the epic suite "Scenes From an Italian Restaurant" feels like a show-stopping closer -- there\'s no denying that the melodies of each song on The Stranger are memorable, so much so that they strengthen the weaker portions of the album. Joel rarely wrote a set of songs better than those on The Stranger, nor did he often deliver an album as consistently listenable. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

Opening with the 11-minute melodramatic exercise "Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding" -- as prog as Elton ever got -- Goodbye Yellow Brick Road immediately embraces excess but also tunefulness, as John immediately switches over to "Candle in the Wind" and "Bennie & the Jets," two songs that form the core of his canon and go a long way toward explaining the over-stuffed appeal of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. This was truly the debut of Elton John the entertainer, the pro who knows how to satisfy every segment of his audience, and this eagerness to please means the record is giddy but also overwhelming, a rush of too much muchness. Still, taken a side at a time, or even a song a time, it is a thing of wonder, serving up such perfectly sculpted pop songs as "Grey Seal," full-bore rockers as "Saturday Night\'s Alright for Fighting" and "Your Sister Can\'t Twist (But She Can Rock & Roll)," cinematic ballads like "I\'ve Seen That Movie Too," throwbacks to the dusty conceptual sweep of Tumbleweed Connection in the form of "The Ballad of Danny Bailey (1909-34)," and preposterous glam novelties, like "Jamaica Jerk-Off." This touched on everything John did before, and suggested ways he\'d move in the near-future, and that sprawl is always messy but usually delightful, a testament to Elton\'s \'70s power as a star and a musician. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

            summary: 'There is no other album like Bat Out of Hell, unless you want to count the sequel. This is Grand Guignol pop -- epic, gothic, operatic, and silly, and it\'s appealing because of all of this. Jim Steinman was a composer without peer, simply because nobody else wanted to make mini-epics like this. And there never could have been a singer more suited for his compositions than Meat Loaf, a singer partial to bombast, albeit shaded bombast. The compositions are staggeringly ridiculous, yet Meat Loaf finds the emotional core in each song, bringing true heartbreak to "Two out of Three Ain\'t Bad" and sly humor to "Paradise by the Dashboard Light." There\'s no discounting the production of Todd Rundgren, either, who gives Steinman\'s self-styled grandiosity a production that\'s staggeringly big but never overwhelming and always alluring. While the sentiments are deliberately adolescent and filled with jokes and exaggerated clichés, there\'s real (albeit silly) wit behind these compositions, not just in the lyrics but in the music, which is a savvy blend of oldies pastiche, show tunes, prog rock, Springsteen-esque narratives, and blistering hard rock (thereby sounding a bit like an extension of Rocky Horror Picture Show, which brought Meat Loaf to the national stage). It may be easy to dismiss this as ridiculous, but there\'s real style and craft here and its kitsch is intentional. It may elevate adolescent passion to operatic dimensions, and that\'s certainly silly, but it\'s hard not to marvel at the skill behind this grandly silly, irresistible album.

            summary: 'Success didn\'t change Midnight Oil with their 1990 album Blue Sky Mining. The Australian band had finally broken through with their previous record, Diesel and Dust, but chart accomplishments didn\'t temper the group. Blue Sky Mining found lead singer Peter Garrett and the boys singing about familiar themes with their usual passion. The songs aren\'t quite on par with those from Diesel and Dust, but there\'s still enough here to make it a worthy follow-up. The lead track "Blue Sky Mine" deals with the oppression of the lower working class within the context of a mining company. The immediately catchy cut managed to find mid-chart success. Other notable tracks are the driving "Forgotten Years," which also managed a bit of airplay, and the menacing "Mountains of Burma." The band stumble only once, on the clumsy love song "Shakers and Movers." [A remastered, limited edition of Blue Sky Mining was released in 2014.] ~ Tom Demalon',

            summary: 'Midnight Oil frontman Peter Garrett has long been active in elective politics in Australia, and like any good politician, he knows that sometimes the most important thing is to get your message out to the masses, even it means speaking with a bit less force than might be your custom. While the hard edges and challenging angles of 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and Red Sails in the Sunset made Midnight Oil bona fide superstars in Australia, they were little more than a rumor in most of the rest of the world, and for their sixth album, Diesel and Dust, Midnight Oil made some changes in their approach. On Diesel and Dust, there\'s less in the way of bruising hard rock like "Best of Both Worlds," nothing as eccentric as "Outside World," and very little as esoterically regional as "Jimmy Sharman\'s Boxers," while the production favors the tuneful side of the band\'s songwriting (which, truth to tell, was always there) and buffs away some of the group\'s harsher edges. As a result, Diesel and Dust isn\'t an album for hardcore Oils fans, but as a bid for a larger audience, it was both shrewd and well executed -- it was the group\'s first real worldwide success, going platinum in America and spawning a massive hit single, "Beds Are Burning." While the album lacks the kick-in-the-head impact of their earlier work, Diesel and Dust also makes clear that the bandmembers could apply their intelligence and passion to less aggressive material and still come up with forceful, compelling music, as on the haunting "The Dead Heart" and the poppy but emphatic "Dreamworld." And as always, there was no compromise in the band\'s forceful political stance -- most of the album\'s songs deal openly with the issues of Aboriginal rights (hardly an issue pertinent only to Australians), and one of Midnight Oil\'s greatest victories may well be writing a song explicitly demanding reparations for indigenous peoples, and seeing it top the charts around the world. And the closer, "Sometimes," may be the finest and most moving anthem the band ever wrote ("Sometimes you\'re beaten to the core/Sometimes you\'re taken to the wall/But you don\'t give in"). Diesel and Dust is that rarity, a bid for the larger audience that\'s also an artistic success and a triumph for leftist politics -- even the Clash never managed that hat trick this well. [Diesel and Dust was re-released in 2014.] ~ Mark Deming',

            summary: 'Between 1976 and 1987, the Alan Parsons Project released ten studio albums, most of them going at least gold in the U.S., several generating big hit singles, too. This was enough to sustain a vigorous cult audience well into 2014, which is when Legacy boxed all ten of the Alan Parsons Project albums, adding the scrapped 1981 record The Sicilian Defense to bring in the hardcore who already have purchased this catalog several times over, including deluxe editions that contain bonus material nowhere to be found here. Aside from The Sicilian Defense, a tedious exercise in art rock designed to get APP out of their contract with Arista (it\'s hard not to see why the label asked them to go back in the studio; The Sicilian Defense is all formless instrumentals, lacking the drama of 1980\'s The Turn of a Friendly Card or the crossover soft rock of 1982\'s Eye in the Sky), extras aren\'t the reason to get this set. This is, like so many similar box sets in the 2010s, a tidy and affordable to get a good-sounding, good-looking complete discography from a notable album rock artist, so if you happen to be in the market for a deep dive into the Alan Parsons Project, this is the way to go. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

            summary: 'Tales of Mystery and Imagination is an extremely mesmerizing aural journey through some of Edgar Allan Poe\'s most renowned works. With the use of synthesizers, drums, guitar, and even a glockenspiel, Parsons\' shivering effects make way for an eerie excursion into Poe\'s well-known classics. On the album\'s 1987 remix, the instrumental "Dream Within a Dream" has Orson Welles narrating in front of this wispy collaboration of guitars and keyboards (Welles also narrates "Fall of the House of Usher: Prelude"). The EMI vocoder is used throughout "The Raven" with the Westminster City School Boys Choir mixed in to add a distinct flair to its chamber-like sound. Parsons\' expertise surrounds this album, from the slyness that prevails in "(The System Of) Doctor Tarr and Professor Feather" to the bodeful thumping of the drums that imitate a heartbeat on "The Tell-Tale Heart." "The Fall of the House of Usher" is a lengthy but dazzling array of musicianship that keeps the album\'s persona intact, while enabling the listener to submerge into its frightening atmosphere. With vocalists Terry Sylvester, John Miles, and Eric Woolfson stretched across each track, this variety of different singing styles adds color and design to the album\'s air. Without any underlying theme to be pondered upon, Alan Parsons instead paints a vivid picture of one of the most alluring literary figures in history by musically reciting his most famous works in expert fashion. ~ Mike DeGagne',

            summary: 'At its best, the Romantics\' self-titled debut album sounds like the greatest album Shel Talmy never produced. The Detroit band\'s British Invasion-style power pop may not have been an especially original creation, but it was good enough that no one with a taste for high-voltage hooks would ever dream of complaining, and as a meeting of mid-\'60s style and late-\'70s volume and passion, it\'s all but flawless. The original songs, written by guitarists Wally Palmar and Mike Skill and drummer Jimmy Marinos, are a glorious pastiche of period pop styles (think the Kinks and the Easybeats with a bit of the Hollies thrown in for melodic appeal) played with a hard-stomping energy and a genuine love for the vintage style that doesn\'t reek of nostalgia. The production by Peter Solley is simple but smart enough to put both the hooks at the energy up front where they belong, and the Romantics never had a set of tunes this strong again; "What I Like About You" richly deserved its status as a hit single, and "When I Look in Your Eyes," "Tell It to Carrie" and "Girl Next Door" would have followed it up the charts in a just world. the Romantics didn\'t exactly reinvent the wheel with this album, but they sure knew how to make it roll, and for sheer party enhancing energy, this album is hard to beat.

            summary: 'An even slicker record than Manifesto, Flesh + Blood precariously balances between alluringly seductive, sophisticated soul-pop and cloying, radio-ready disco-pop. At its best, the album is effortlessly suave and charming -- "Over You" is one of their greatest singles, and "Oh Yeah" is nearly as persuasive -- but much of the record is devoted to ill-formed, stylish lounge-pop. In particular, the reliance on reworked covers of "In the Midnight Hour" and "Eight Miles High" is distressing, not only because it signals a lack of imagination, but also because it suggests that Flesh + Blood is simply a lesser solo effort from Bryan Ferry. And even the handful of undeniably strong moments can\'t erase the feeling that Roxy Music were beginning to run out of ideas. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

Every one of Joe Satriani\'s studio albums, beginning with his indie 1985 release Not of This Earth and concluding with 2013\'s Unstoppable Momentum, can be found in a newly remastered version by Satriani and producer John Cuniberti in this attractively priced, clamshell mini-box of CDs presented as mini-LPs. This alone would be a hefty haul -- the set amounts to 14 albums released over the course of nearly three decades -- but for the dedicated there\'s a supplemental compilation called Additional Creations and Bonus Tracks, which rounds up stray songs and unheard cuts. This has its moments, but the main reason to purchase The Complete Studio Recordings is to get Satriani\'s core catalog at an attractive price, especially as the albums sound better than ever. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

            summary: 'Both artistically and commercially, Boz Scaggs had his greatest success with Silk Degrees. The laid-back singer hit the R&B charts in a big way with the addictive, sly "Lowdown" (which has been sampled by more than a few rappers and remains a favorite among baby-boomer soul fans) and expressed his love of smooth soul music almost as well on the appealing "What Can I Say." But Scaggs was essentially a pop/rocker, and in that area he has a considerable amount of fun on "Lido Shuffle" (another major hit single), "What Do You Want the Girl to Do," and "Jump Street." Meanwhile, "We\'re All Alone" and "Harbor Lights" became staples on adult contemporary radio. Though not remarkable, the ballads have more heart than most of the bland material dominating that format. [A 2007 re-release added three bonus tracks, "What Can I Say," "Jump Street," and "It\'s Over."] ~ Alex Henderson',

            summary: 'Only from the Rhino Handmade web-based audio salon could such a fulfilling reissue project have likewise been so thoroughly executed. Keen-eyed and eared pop music enthusiasts will undoubtedly recognize Jack Nitzsche from his involvement with Phil Spector\'s "Wrecking Crew" and later as a producer/arranger and writer for a spectrum of talent that includes but is by no means limited to Leslie Gore, Art Pepper, Tim Buckley, Neil Young, John Tesh, Mink DeVille, and the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. Three Piece Suite: The Reprise Recordings 1971-1974 gathers three disparate sonic situations under which Nitzsche recorded, and of these only the orchestrated St. Giles Cripplegate has been issued in any form. Very little is known with regard to the other recordings, besides the fact that they were on deposit in the Warner Bros. tape archives. St. Giles Cripplegate features the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) performing six original Nitzsche scores. According to Elliot Mazer\'s liner notes essay, the album was the direct result of the jaw-dropping orchestral arrangements Nitzsche had done for Neil Young\'s Harvest album -- specifically on the tracks "There\'s a World" and "A Man Needs a Maid." Although his musical scope was indeed broad by any standards, these sides are more akin to Frank Zappa\'s symphonic experimentations and compositions than anything linked to Nitzsche\'s name. Each of the works is unique, exploring various sonic boundaries. For example, "No. 6" -- the album\'s opener -- is a vertigo-inducing swirl of demented strings and bombastic percussion, capped off with a dramatic brass flourish. This starkly contrasts with the comparably sedate and languid "No. 4 (For Mori)" -- which foreshadows his work on Milos Foreman\'s One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest original soundtrack. The next 11 tracks on this compilation were recorded, assembled, and even bestowed a Reprise catalog number under the eponymous title Jack Nitzsche -- yet the project remained virtually forgotten. According to the thoroughly entertaining discographical annotations, no records exist to confirm exactly who performs on these sides. With a nod to primal Todd Rundgren and the quirky harmonic genius of Brian Wilson, tracks such as "Lower California" and "I\'m the Loneliest Fool" recall the idiosyncratic nature of his collaborative efforts with Van Dyke Parks, and arrangements for Tim Buckley and the Buffalo Springfield. These sides may likely be the greatest discovery the archivists at Rhino Handmade have released. Along with lyrical contributions from director Robert Downey, Nitzsche creates more than music. He is, in effect, altering mood through sound. The disc closes with four demos that chronologically fall between St. Giles Cripplegate and the unissued self-titled project mentioned above. These stark performances reveal a sensitivity and intimacy that were previously only hinted at. According to the liner notes -- which were penned by longtime Nitzsche pal and housemate Denny Bruce -- the track "I\'ll Bet She Knew It" was named after the legendary Jeannie Franklyn, a seamstress in Los Angeles for many a rock & roller. She was likewise immortalized in the song "Tiny Dancer" as the "blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band." Likewise, "Carly" is a tongue-in-cheek paeon to the burgeoning singer/songwriter scare of the early \'70s. Three Piece Suite is limited to an edition of 3,000 copies and available through Rhino Handmade. ~ Lindsay Planer',

            summary: 'The British band Sniff \'n\' the Tears\' 1978 debut, Fickle Heart, is best known for containing the relentlessly catchy rocker "Driver\'s Seat," which became a hit in 1979 and is simply one of the greatest one-hit wonder singles of that decade, and arguably of all time. Killer keyboard and synthesizer riffs by Alan Fealdman and guest Keith Miller, piercing electric guitars by Loz Netto and Mick Dyche, solid bass by Chris Birkin, steady drums by producer Luigi Salvoni, and bandleader/songwriter Paul Roberts\' incessant acoustic rhythm guitar and dramatic lead vocals are all terrific individually, but they add up to a fantastic whole. "Driver\'s Seat" is the leadoff track on Fickle Heart and, while it\'s hard to follow up a classic tune, the album does have some other good songs that are also strong, melodic rock. Sniff \'n\' the Tears is sometimes classified as a new wave band, but that\'s not really accurate. The occasional synthesizer bits spice up Sniff \'n\' the Tears\' music, but they don\'t dominate it. "New Lines on Love" and "This Side of the Blue Horizon" are both richly textured with various keyboards and guitars. "The Thrill of It All" has a dark and mysterious feel due to Roberts\' sly vocal style. "Looking for You" isn\'t as brooding, and the warm keyboard solos are enjoyable. Roberts, an accomplished painter, created the lifelike, photograph-quality cover painting for Fickle Heart and the band\'s subsequent albums. However, Roberts dissolved the Fickle Heart lineup and formed an entirely new version of Sniff \'n\' the Tears for 1980s Games Up. [This edition contains bonus tracks.] ~ Bret Adams',

            summary: 'Essentially a harder-rocking reprise of Every Picture Tells a Story, Never a Dull Moment never quite reaches the heights of its predecessor, but it\'s a wonderful, multi-faceted record in its own right. Opening with the touching, autobiographical rocker "True Blue," which finds Rod Stewart trying to come to grips with his newfound stardom but concluding that he\'d "rather be back home," the record is the last of Stewart\'s series of epic fusions of hard rock and folk. It\'s possible to hear Stewart go for superstardom with the hard-rocking kick and fat electric guitars of the album, but the songs still cut to the core. "You Wear It Well" is a "Maggie May" rewrite on the surface, but it develops into a touching song about being emotionally inarticulate. Similarly, "Lost Paraguayos" is funny, driving folk-rock, and it\'s hard not to be swept away when the Stonesy hard rocker "Italian Girls" soars into a mandolin-driven coda. The covers -- whether a soulful reading of Jimi Hendrix\'s "Angel," an empathetic version of Dylan\'s "Mama, You Been on My Mind," or a stunning interpretation of Etta James\' "I\'d Rather Go Blind" -- are equally effective, making Never a Dull Moment a masterful record. He never got quite this good ever again. [A limited-edition remastered CD was released in 2014.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

            summary: 'In 1982, the unexpected success of the Stray Cats\' American debut, Built for Speed, made America aware that rockabilly, previously believed to be extinct, was actually alive and well somewhere in New Jersey (though the evidence had to be taken to England before anyone would notice). Pulling together six songs from the Stray Cats\' self-titled debut, five tunes from the follow-up Gonna Ball, and one previously unreleased number (the title song), Built for Speed is song-for-song the group\'s strongest album, despite the cut-and-paste manner in which it was created. Originality was never this band\'s strongest suit, and as songwriters the Stray Cats rarely wandered far from the traditional themes of cars, girls, rockin\', and their own level of coolness, but Brian Setzer\'s fleet-fingered guitar work revealed that he\'d absorbed the lessons of Cliff Gallup, James Burton, and Scotty Moore and constructed an impressive and colorful style of his own from the parts, while Lee Rocker and Slim Jim Phantom were an admirably potent and appropriately uncluttered rhythm section (the clean, streamlined production, by Dave Edmunds on most cuts, also helped quite a bit). If the group\'s songs haven\'t all worn the test of time especially well, the melodies are strong and the playing is tight and enthusiastic throughout. While you\'re better off with a good collection from Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, or Charlie Feathers, there are a lot worse ways you could learn about rockabilly than to pick up Built for Speed -- which is a good thing, since if you were born after 1965, chances are it was where you learned about rockabilly. ~ Mark Deming',

            summary: `The problem with defining an era is, what are you going to do for an encore? It's a dilemma that has impaled many a worthy one-hit-wonder in the past, but few struggled more desperately against the inevitable than Thunderclap Newman, the group that could...nay, should...have defined the first half of the 1970s for anyone tired of the '60s supergroups, but who vanished instead into the box marked "Whatever Happened To?"␊
            That, of course, is another essay entirely. But their immediate future -- that is, the weeks and months that followed the worldwide success of "Something in the Air" -- caught them creating one of the key albums of the age, a set that confirmed Speedy Keen among the finest British songwriters of his generation; that brought Pete Townshend production kudos that he never even tried to touch again; that bristled with at least half a dozen more surefire monster hits...and which sank like the proverbial stone. And still no one can tell you why.␊
            A re-recorded take on the hit opens the album; intriguingly, elements of the song's multitudinous hooks then appear and reappear throughout the remainder of the set -- a piano riff here, a bassline there. It brings a continuity to the album that puts one in mind of the similar tricks played by labelmates The Crazy World of Arthur Brown on their 1968 debut album, but they spread the joy over one side of the album only. Hollywood Dream bristles with hints and reminders, to bring the album an almost conceptual sheen, at the same time as the songs themselves race away in a dozen different directions. ␊
            Three parts of "Hollywood" offer up a deliciously cynical examination of the movie scene, buoyed by an almost childishly lovely melody; "Accidents," on the other hand, flips from a guilt-ridden catalog of childhood mishaps to a blindingly psychedelic instrumental passage -- at nine minutes, the album version is thrice as long as the maybe-familiar 45 rpm cut, and it's no exaggeration to say it's three times better, as well.␊
            From start to finish, then, Hollywood Dream is, indeed, a dream, an album for everyone and for all occasions. If you don't own it, you need to. And if you do, then why aren't you listening to it right now? ~ Dave Thompson`,

            summary: 'It\'s as easy to see why radio listeners loved Toto as it is to see why critics hated them. Toto\'s rock-studio chops allowed them to play any current pop style at the drop of a hi-hat: one minute prog rock, the next hard rock, the next funky R&B. It all sounded great, but it also implied that music-making took craft rather than inspiration and that the musical barriers critics like to erect were arbitrary. Then, too, Toto\'s timing couldn\'t have been much worse. They rode in during the middle of punk/new wave with its D.I.Y. aesthetic, and their sheer competence was an affront. Of course, there\'s always been an alternate history of popular music not available to rock critics (it\'s written in record stores and concert halls and on the radio), and in that story, Toto was a smash. Singles like "I\'ll Supply the Love" and "Georgy Porgy" (featuring Cheryl Lynn) made the charts, and "Hold the Line" hit the Top Ten and went gold. The members of Toto had already influenced the course of \'70s popular music by playing on half the albums that came out of L.A. All they were doing with this album was going public. [A remastered, limited-edition version of the album was released on CD in 2014.] ~ William Ruhlmann',

            summary: 'Rhino reissued expanded versions of all the Yes albums in the early days of the new millennium, so this 2013 set doesn\'t see either a massive sonic upgrade or expansion. Instead, those acclaimed remasters -- including the expansion of Big Generator, which hadn\'t seen U.S. release prior to this -- are now packaged in mini-LP cardboard sleeves and put into a box with new artwork designed by Roger Dean. Apart from the art, this may not offer hardcore Yes fans anything they don\'t already have -- that\'s assuming they didn\'t opt to purchase an import of Big Generator in the first place -- but this is an easy, attractive, and relatively affordable way to get the band\'s core catalog in one fell swoop. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

            summary: 'Johnny Cash\'s first album, released on Sun in 1957, is a little more folkloric and traditional than what he put on most of his singles, though not pronouncedly so. In fact, four of the tracks ("I Walk the Line," "Cry! Cry! Cry!," "So Doggone Lonesome," and "Folsom Prison Blues") had already been hit singles. For the rest of the set, Cash drew on some older folk ("Rock Island Line," "The Wreck of the Old \'97"), country ("[I Heard That] Lonesome Whistle," "Remember Me [I\'m the One Who Loves You]"), prison ("Doin\' My Time"), and spiritual ("I Was There When It Happened") songs. Filling out the set is a good, rollicking Cash original, "Country Boy," and a rather sassy tune by the young Jerry Reed, "If the Good Lord\'s Willing." It\'s a good, solid record that\'s very much in the mold of his classic early Sun sound, with spare accompaniment that nevertheless often approaches a rockabilly-country bounce. ~ Richie Unterberger',

            summary: 'With their surprise success behind them, the Cranberries went ahead and essentially created a sequel to Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\'t We with only tiny variations, with mixed results. The fact that the album is essentially a redo of previously established stylistic ground isn\'t apparent in just the production, handled again by Stephen Street, or the overall sound, or even that one particularly fine song is called "Dreaming My Dreams." Everybody wasn\'t a laugh riot, to be sure, but No Need to Argue starts to see O\'Riordan take a more commanding and self-conscious role that ended up not standing the band in good stead later. Lead single "Zombie" is the offender in this regard -- the heavy rock trudge isn\'t immediately suited for the band\'s strengths (notably, O\'Riordan wrote this without Noel Hogan) -- while the subject matter (the continuing Northern Ireland tensions) ends up sounding trivialized. Opening cut "Ode to My Family" is actually one of the band\'s best, with a lovely string arrangement created by O\'Riordan, her overdubbed vocals showing her distinct vocal tics. Where No Need succeeds best is when the Cranberries stick at what they know, resulting in a number of charmers like "Twenty One," the uilleann pipes-touched "Daffodil\'s Lament," which has an epic sweep that doesn\'t overbear like "Zombie," and the evocative "Disappointment."

            summary: 'In a word, stunning. Perhaps an odd word to use given that Violator continued in the general vein of the previous two studio efforts by Depeche Mode: Martin Gore\'s upfront lyrical emotional extremism and knack for a catchy hook filtered through Alan Wilder\'s ear for perfect arrangements, ably assisted by top English producer Flood. Yet the idea that this record would both dominate worldwide charts, while song for song being simply the best, most consistent effort yet from the band could only have been the wildest fantasy before its release. The opening two singles from the album, however, signaled something was up. First was "Personal Jesus," at once perversely simplistic, with a stiff, arcane funk/hip-hop beat and basic blues guitar chords, and tremendous, thanks to sharp production touches and David Gahan\'s echoed, snaky vocals. Then "Enjoy the Silence," a nothing-else-remains-but-us ballad pumped up into a huge, dramatic romance/dance number, commanding in its mock orchestral/choir scope. Follow-up single "Policy of Truth" did just fine as well, a low-key Motown funk number for the modern day with a sharp love/hate lyric to boot. To top it all off, the album itself scored on song after song, from the shuffling beat of "Sweetest Perfection" (well sung by Gore) and the ethereal "Waiting for the Night" to the guilt-ridden-and-loving-it "Halo" building into a string-swept pounder. "Clean" wraps up Violator on an eerie note, all ominous bass notes and odd atmospherics carrying the song. Goth without ever being stupidly hammy, synth without sounding like the clinical stereotype of synth music, rock without ever sounding like a "rock" band, Depeche here reach astounding heights indeed.

            summary: `It's a bit tempting to peg Green Day's sprawling, ambitious, brilliant seventh album, American Idiot, as their version of a Who album, the next logical step forward from the Kinks-inspired popcraft of their underrated 2000 effort, Warning, but things aren't quite that simple. American Idiot is an unapologetic, unabashed rock opera, a form that Pete Townshend pioneered with Tommy, but Green Day doesn't use that for a blueprint as much as they use the Who's mini-opera "A Quick One, While He's Away," whose whirlwind succession of 90-second songs isn't only emulated on two song suites here, but provides the template for the larger 13-song cycle. But the Who are only one of many inspirations on this audacious, immensely entertaining album. The story of St. Jimmy has an arc similar to Hüsker Dü's landmark punk-opera Zen Arcade, while the music has grandiose flourishes straight out of both Queen and Rocky Horror Picture Show (the '50s pastiche "Rock and Roll Girlfriend" is punk rock Meat Loaf), all tied together with a nervy urgency and a political passion reminiscent of the Clash, or all the anti-Reagan American hardcore bands of the '80s. These are just the clearest touchstones for American Idiot, but reducing the album to its influences gives the inaccurate impression that this is no more than a patchwork quilt of familiar sounds, when it's an idiosyncratic, visionary work in its own right. First of all, part of Green Day's appeal is how they have personalized the sounds of the past, making time-honored guitar rock traditions seem fresh, even vital. With their first albums, they styled themselves after first-generation punk they were too young to hear firsthand, and as their career progressed, the group not only synthesized these influences into something distinctive, but chief songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong turned into a muscular, versatile songwriter in his own right. ␍␊
            Warning illustrated their growing musical acumen quite impressively, but here, the music isn't only tougher, it's fluid and, better still, it fuels the anger, disillusionment, heartbreak, frustration, and scathing wit at the core of American Idiot. And one of the truly startling things about American Idiot is how the increased musicality of the band is matched by Armstrong's incisive, cutting lyrics, which effectively convey the paranoia and fear of living in American in days after 9/11, but also veer into moving, intimate small-scale character sketches. There's a lot to absorb here, and cynics might dismiss it after one listen as a bit of a mess when it's really a rich, multi-faceted work, one that is bracing upon the first spin and grows in stature and becomes more addictive with each repeated play. Like all great concept albums, American Idiot works on several different levels. It can be taken as a collection of great songs -- songs that are as visceral or as poignant as Green Day at their best, songs that resonate outside of the larger canvas of the story, as the fiery anti-Dubya title anthem proves -- but these songs have a different, more lasting impact when taken as a whole. While its breakneck, freewheeling musicality has many inspirations, there really aren't many records like American Idiot (bizarrely enough, the Fiery Furnaces' Blueberry Boat is one of the closest, at least on a sonic level, largely because both groups draw deeply from the kaleidoscopic "A Quick One"). In its musical muscle and sweeping, politically charged narrative, it's something of a masterpiece, and one of the few -- if not the only -- records of 2004 to convey what it feels like to live in the strange, bewildering America of the early 2000s. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine`,

            summary: `It may be far too obvious to even mention that Norah Jones' follow-up to her 18-million-unit-selling, eight-Grammy-winning, genre-bending, super-smash album Come Away with Me has perhaps a bit too much to live up to. But that's probably the biggest conundrum for Jones: having to follow up the phenomenal success of an album that was never designed to be so hugely popular in the first place. Come Away with Me was a little album by an unknown pianist/vocalist who attempted to mix jazz, country, and folk in an acoustic setting -- who knew? Feels Like Home could be seen as "Come Away with Me Again" if not for that fact that it's actually better. Smartly following the template forged by Jones and producer Arif Mardin, there is the intimate single "Sunrise," some reworked cover tunes, some interesting originals, and one ostensible jazz standard. These are all good things, for also like its predecessor, Feels Like Home is a soft and amiable album that frames Jones' soft-focus Aretha Franklin voice with a group of songs that are as classy as they are quiet. Granted, not unlike the dippy albeit catchy hit "Don't Know Why," they often portend deep thoughts but come off in the end more like heartfelt daydreams. Of course, Jones could sing the phone book and make it sound deep, and that's what's going to keep listeners coming back. ␍␊
            What's surprising here are the bluesy, more jaunty songs that really dig into the country stylings only hinted at on Come Away with Me. To these ends, the infectious shuffle of "What Am I to You?" finds Jones truly coming into her own as a blues singer as well as a writer. Her voice has developed a spine-tingling breathy scratch that pulls on your ear as she rises to the chorus. Similarly, "Toes" and "Carnival Town" -- co-written by bassist Lee Alexander and Jones -- are pure '70s singer/songwriting that call to mind a mix of Rickie Lee Jones and k.d. lang. Throw in covers of Tom Waits and Townes Van Zandt along with Duke Ellington's "Melancholia," retitled here "Don't Miss You at All" and featuring lyrics by Jones, and you've got an album so blessed with superb songwriting that Jones' vocals almost push the line into too much of a good thing. Thankfully, there is also a rawness and organic soulfulness in the production that's refreshing. No digital pitch correction was employed in the studio and you can sometimes catch Jones hitting an endearingly sour note. She also seems to be making good on her stated desire to remain a part of a band. Most all of her sidemen, who've worked with the likes of Tom Waits and Cassandra Wilson, get writing credits. It's a "beauty and the beast" style partnership that harks back to the best Brill Building-style intentions and makes for a quietly experimental and well-balanced album. ~ Matt Collar`,

            summary: 'It\'s no secret that the Leeds-based Kaiser Chiefs love the Jam. The band\'s 2005 excellent but uneven debut Employment was an infectious salute to all things mod and Brit-pop, boasting three solid singles ("I Predict a Riot," "Oh My God" and "Everyday I Love You Less and Less") that held great promise for future endeavors. On Yours Truly, Angry Mob, the group takes a little more time in establishing its pop acumen, offering no immediate pay-offs despite its insatiable thirst for FM melody. Opener and first single "Ruby," a rowdy, mid-tempo singalong that gets everything right but feels a little tossed-off and disposable, is indicative of Angry Mob\'s first half -- "Heat Dies Down," "Love\'s Not a Competition (But I\'m Winning)" and "Highroyds" have all of their cogs well-oiled and reliably dressed, but there\'s nothing here that warrants the inevitable second listen in which a perfectly constructed pop song\'s true genius is revealed. To that end, Angry Mob is creatively back loaded (though not genius), relying on a series of rewarding and occasionally subversive tracks like "I Can Do It Without You," "Learnt My Lesson Well," "My Kind of Guy" and closer "Retirement" to avoid the dreaded sophomore slump, revealing a band that is likely to continue pumping out albums with a few great songs on them until the requisite "Greatest Hits" collection arrives. [Yours Truly, Angry Mob is also available in an edition with three bonus tracks and a bonus DVD.] ~ James Christopher Monger',

            summary: 'The Kooks arrived fully formed in 2006, for their debut sounds like the work of a band well into its career: the confidence with which the foursome from Brighton play and the abandon with which Luke Pritchard sings; the witty songcraft and deft arrangements; the drama and fervor they unleash from the very first notes and carry through to the end. They display maturity but also play with the fervor of kids and project a wide-eyed charm that is very endearing. On most of Inside In/Inside Out, the band sounds like a more energetic Thrills or a looser Sam Roberts Band, maybe even a less severe Arctic Monkeys at times. Along with these modern kinships and influences, the band is heavily indebted to classic rock. Traces of Thin Lizzy\'s romantic lyricism pop up on tracks like "Eddie\'s Gun," and so does a bit of post-punk spikiness on "You Don\'t Love Me," some Dexys singalong booziness on "She Moves in Her Own Way," and a hint of jam-band funk on "Match Box." Quite varied influences, and in the end the band sounds like the Kooks and no one else. A nice and unique sound doesn\'t mean much without some songs to fill it out, and the Kooks deliver plenty of memorable tunes. "Eddie\'s Gun," "See the World," the unfortunately named "Jackie Big Tits," and "Ooh La" are very strong and, taken together, equal the output of just about any pop/rock band around in 2006. The only song that falls flat is the over-long reggae-rocker "Time Awaits." It\'s the only track that breaks the four-minute mark, and it shows that the Kooks\' strength isn\'t stretching out and jamming; their chops are best suited for short, sharp blasts of invigorating pop/rock. When they stick to that, the Kooks are an exciting, very promising band, and Inside In/Inside Out is an excellent debut. [Inside In/Inside Out was released on LP in 2016.] ~ Tim Sendra',

            summary: 'Muse lead vocalist Matthew Bellamy\'s vocal timbre bears some similarity to that of Thom Yorke, leading some to dismiss Muse as simply a band of Radiohead worshipers. With Absolution, however, the group proves that it\'s much more than the sum of its influences, delivering a work that revels in the enormity of its ambition, the breadth of its sonic palette, and the intensity of its emotional resonance. Employing a daring mix of classical-influenced piano and strings, metallic guitars, unabashedly strident house-style synths, and the type of production bombast usually reserved for Queen or ELO, Muse often sound like an otherworldly jam session between Rufus Wainwright, the Move, and Evanescence. Packed with both pop hooks and unusual instrumental textures, Absolution invites listeners to expect the unexpected. ~ Pemberton Roach',

            summary: 'The surprise hit of the 1994 summer movie season traces the life of a half-wit through the major historical events of the 1950s, \'60s, and \'70s, and this soundtrack album is a travelogue of the same period, from Elvis Presley\'s 1956 hit "Hound Dog" to Bob Seger\'s 1980 hit "Against the Wind." Like the movie, the soundtrack to Forrest Gump succeeds at repackaging the familiar -- in the film, we revisit everything from desegregation and the Vietnam War to the self-centered trends of the \'70s, and on the soundtrack, we hear the concurrent hits for the umpteenth time -- although, unlike the movie, the soundtrack doesn\'t trivialize what it recycles. Playing it is basically like listening to an oldies radio station, minus the commercials and annoying DJ patter, but just like many other song-oriented soundtracks, this is still a miscellaneous collection. That, however, didn\'t keep it from shooting into the Top Ten as the movie became a blockbuster. The double-CD version contains eight more tracks than the cassette. ~ William Ruhlmann',

            summary: 'The problem with compiling an essential best-of compilation covering the phenomenon that was (and is) Elvis Presley is the very man himself, who has passed from this mortal coil into the iconic pop culture stratosphere where even his own death is questioned and Elvis sightings are as frequent as fleas. Then there are the thousands of performers who daily dress up as Presley himself and sally forth into the world like perfectly gyrating replicas of either the early or later Elvis (body physics dictate that you can\'t be both). Elvis may have left the building, but not really. His image is everywhere, and his fans are legion and devout. So how does one pick his essential sides when "Do the Clam" is a classic in the Kingdom of Presley simply because Elvis did it? He recorded Tony Joe White\'s "Polk Salad Annie" in 1970. It was hardly the best version ever of "Polk Salad Annie" but it was Elvis\' version of "Polk Salad Annie," which puts it in rarefied class of its own, and making it, like "Do the Clam," absolutely essential in some quarters. When you\'re larger than life, words like essential have to expand or be left wanting. The Essential Elvis Presley boils this imposing legacy down to two discs of 20 tracks each, and approaches the problem of what is truly essential by choosing to compile all of Elvis\' significant charting hits, beginning with his 1954 cover of Arthur Crudup\'s "That\'s All Right" from Sam Phillips\' Sun Records and continuing chronologically through Presley\'s long association with RCA Records through the year 1976. That means, while there\'s no version of "Do the Clam" ("Polk Salad Annie" is here, though), there are classic sides like 1956\'s "Heartbreak Hotel," "Don\'t Be Cruel," "Hound Dog," and "Love Me Tender," 1957\'s "Jailhouse Rock," 1961\'s "Little Sister," and 1969\'s "In the Ghetto," "Suspicious Minds," and "Kentucky Rain." There are 17 number one hits and a whole lot more. Elvis fanatics are going to complain about what isn\'t here, of course. Elvis is the King, after all, and therefore by definition everything he recorded ought to be essential. And everything he recorded is indeed essential on some level. But these are the sides that broke through to the deepest level of the world pop culture that Elvis helped create. These are the songs that broke him and then sustained him on radio and television and at the movie theaters. Die-hard Elvis fans will undoubtedly already have everything collected here. This is a set instead for folks who want to have at least one Elvis anthology in their collections, and want the hits they remember and don\'t much care if those hits are from the early Elvis or the later Elvis or the dear departed Elvis. Just the hits, bartender, shaken not stirred. That means no version of "Do the Clam," singular as it is. ~ Steve Leggett',

            summary: 'On Begin to Hope, Regina Spektor treads a delicate balance between her anti-folk past and her present home on Sire Records. Though the label re-released Soviet Kitsch in 2004, Begin to Hope is Spektor\'s first original material for Sire, and it feels more like a major-label debut than Soviet Kitsch ever did. The album\'s big, glossy production and preponderance of drum machines and keyboards inches Spektor toward territory that isn\'t exactly mainstream, but is closer to a more conventional adult alternative singer/songwriter sound. Her songwriting mirrors this, too: "Field Below," which finds her wishing for the countryside while living in the city, has a mellow, appealingly rambling vibe that grows from the traditional singer/songwriter roots of Joni and Carole; "Better" takes the breathy, literate, pretty side of Spektor\'s music and tailors it into a radio-friendly single. "On the Radio" takes it a step further and becomes a smart, funny, and sad meta-single, with lyrics like "We listened to it twice/Because the DJ was asleep" backed by poppy synths and beats. But even though Begin to Hope\'s first few songs might suggest otherwise, Spektor is much too freewheeling and quirky a talent to stick to the straight and narrow for the entirety. Show tunes, classic soul, the Bible, and the backs of cereal boxes are all inspirations for the album. And whether she quotes the melody from Doris Payne\'s "Just One Look" and pairs it with lyrics about orca whales on "Hotel Song," or begins the lovely, confessional closing track, "Summer in the City," with the line "summer in the city means cleavage," Spektor uses them in unexpected ways. She also places some truly surreal, heady tracks toward Begin to Hope\'s end: "Lady" is a torchy number arranged for piano, saxophone, and typewriter, while "20 Years of Snow" is buoyed along by impressionistic keyboards that twinkle and tumble like a just-shaken snow globe. "Apres Moi," one of the album\'s most impressive tracks, showcases her classical piano training, her Russian heritage, and those biblical influences to ominous, paranoid effect. Leaving the more unique, quintessentially Regina Spektor-esque tracks at the end of Begin to Hope isn\'t so much a bait-and-switch as is a clever way to lure in and loosen the inhibitions of new fans. The album feels like getting to really know someone: at first, it\'s polite and a little restrained, but then its real personality, with all of its charming idiosyncrasies, finally reveals itself. ~ Heather Phares',

            summary: 'Regina Spektor worked with no less than four big-name producers on Far, all of them with very different backgrounds: David Kahne was her collaborator on 2006\'s Begin to Hope; Garret "Jacknife" Lee counts R.E.M. and U2 among his credits; Jeff Lynne\'s lavish sound is famous on ELO\'s albums; and Mike Elizondo has worked with Fiona Apple and Maroon 5. It\'s something of a surprise, then, that Far sounds so homogenized. On Soviet Kitsch and Begin to Hope, Spektor\'s wide-eyed moments were balanced with darker, knowing songs that kept her music grounded. Here, almost all of the rough or unpredictable edges have been smoothed away, and all that\'s left is Spektor\'s sweet, quirky side. At times, Far gets close to being unbearably precious, whether it\'s putting Spektor\'s name in all lowercase letters in the liner notes, her dolphin on the otherwise charming "Folding Chair," or lyrics like "We made our own computer out of macaroni pieces" on the chirpy opener, "The Calculation." Even the album\'s darker tracks, such as the percussion-heavy "Machine," are surprisingly sugary compared to her previous work. However, Spektor\'s guileless voice and delivery allow her to get away with sounds and ideas that would be horribly cloying in the hands of almost any other artist. She manages to make a song with the chorus "Eet, eet, eet" catchy and affecting, and fashions an observant and witty story out of returning a wallet to Blockbuster Video. Still, Far\'s best moments occur when Spektor turns down the whimsy a few notches. It\'s probably not a coincidence that the Kahne-produced "Human of the Year" shares some of Begin to Hope\'s intimacy and ambition, but "Blue Lips" and "Man of a Thousand Faces" also let Spektor\'s more mature -- but not overly serious -- side shine. Likewise, "Two Birds" and "One More Time with Feeling" show that she hasn\'t lost her touch for deceptively pretty pop with clever lyrics. While Far is far from bad, it doesn\'t quite live up to expectations, either, based on all the talent involved in making it and how fully Spektor expressed herself on Begin to Hope. ~ Heather Phares',

            summary: 'Opening with the ominous, fiery protest of "Sunday Bloody Sunday," War immediately announces itself as U2\'s most focused and hardest-rocking album to date. Blowing away the fuzzy, sonic indulgences of October with propulsive, martial rhythms and shards of guitar, War bristles with anger, despair, and above all, passion. Previously, Bono\'s attempts at messages came across as grandstanding, but his vision becomes remarkably clear on this record, as his anthems ("New Year\'s Day," "40," "Seconds") are balanced by effective, surprisingly emotional love songs ("Two Hearts Beat as One"), which are just as desperate and pleading as his protests. He performs the difficult task of making the universal sound personal, and the band helps him out by bringing the songs crashing home with muscular, forceful performances that reveal their varied, expressive textures upon repeated listens. U2 always aimed at greatness, but War was the first time they achieved it. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

            summary: 'The story of Back to Black is one in which celebrity and the potential of commercial success threaten to ruin Amy Winehouse, since the same insouciance and playfulness that made her sound so special when she debuted could easily have been whitewashed right out of existence for this breakout record. (That fact may help to explain why fans were so scared by press allegations that Winehouse had deliberately lost weight in order to present a slimmer appearance.) Although Back to Black does see her deserting jazz and wholly embracing contemporary R&B, all the best parts of her musical character emerge intact, and actually, are all the better for the transformation from jazz vocalist to soul siren. With producer Salaam Remi returning from Frank, plus the welcome addition of Mark Ronson (fresh off successes producing for Christina Aguilera and Robbie Williams), Back to Black has a similar sound to Frank but much more flair and spark to it. Winehouse was inspired by girl group soul of the \'60s, and fortunately Ronson and Remi are two of the most facile and organic R&B producers active. (They certainly know how to evoke the era too; Remi\'s "Tears Dry on Their Own" is a sparkling homage to the Motown chestnut "Ain\'t No Mountain High Enough," and Ronson summons a host of Brill Building touchstones on his tracks.) As before, Winehouse writes all of the songs from her experiences, most of which involve the occasionally riotous and often bittersweet vagaries of love. Also in similar fashion to Frank, her eye for details and her way of relating them are delightful. She states her case against "Rehab" on the knockout first single with some great lines: "They tried to make me go to rehab I won\'t go go go, I\'d rather be at home with Ray" (Charles, that is). As often as not, though, the songs on Back to Black are universal, songs that anyone, even Joss Stone, could take to the top of the charts, such as "Love Is a Losing Game" or the title song ("We only said good bye with words, I died a hundred times/You go back to her, and I go back to black"). ~ John Bush',

            summary: 'The John Butler Trio, Australia’s biggest contribution to the jam band movement, gets a serious makeover on 2010\'s April Uprising. Butler dissolved the previous lineup one year before this album’s release, hoping to keep things fresh with a change in personnel. Newcomers Byron Luiters and Nicky Bomba (Butler’s brother-in-law) make their debut here, and the band further reinvents itself by sticking closer to the alt-rock camp than ever before, with Butler trading his fingerplucked guitar arpeggios for electric riffs and power chords. He’s not entirely done with the genres that fueled his earlier albums -- reggae, folk, pop, and acoustic soul chief among them -- and songs like “Don’t Wanna See Your Face” are familiarly funky, with grooves specifically designed for the festival crowds that sustain the John Butler Trio every summer. Even so, April Uprising signals a change in direction, with a newfound emphasis on rock textures and political lyrics (“Sometimes I do wonder how we do sleep/Serving the dodgy companies we keep”) that make the band sound like a flashier, Aussie equivalent of State Radio. ~ Andrew Leahey',

            summary: 'The sixth long player from the rootsy Australian trio (and first outing in four years) finds bandleader John Butler occupying a more introspective and nostalgic headspace than he has on previous outings. Butler has always been a cerebral gent, although one prone to crafting stadium sized activist anthems like "Earthbound Child" and "Fire in the Sky," but there\'s a more settled vibe to Flesh + Blood that suggests a possible sea change. Opener "Spring to Come," which begins with the lyric "Lost my love, lost my light" and concludes with the line "After a lonely long night comes the sun," sets the mood, offering up a solid foundation of fluid fingerpicking and circular, warm weather rhythms and melodies for Butler to opine over. It\'s a tone and sentiment that occurs frequently throughout the album\'s surprisingly concise (for a jam band) fifty-two minute runtime, and it serves the trio well, especially on more contemplative cuts like "Bullet Girl," "Only One," and the lovely and languid Ainslie Wills-assisted "Young and Wild." To be fair, JBT fans looking for bolder, more familiar strokes have more than a few traditional roots-rock offerings to sift through, some of them solid (the dark and immersive "Cold Wind" and the fun, if not a tad derivative "Livin\' in the City") and some of them not (the turgid, reggae/blues-rock epic "Blame it on Me" and its throwaway, whitebread counterpart "Devil Woman"), but it\'s in the more refined, self reflective moments where Butler, bassist Byron Luiters, and drummer Nicky Bomba really come alive. ~ James Christopher Monger',

            summary: 'James Bay is a young British singer and songwriter whose heartfelt songs and passionate vocal style suggest a greater maturity and experience than one would expect from an artist whose debut album was released when he was 24 years old. Chaos and the Calm, Bay\'s first full-length album following a pair of well-received EPs, reveals he has a precocious talent as a songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist, and is just as comfortable with outgoing tracks like "Collide" as he is with intimate, personal numbers such as "Let It Go" as he winds together elements of pop, folk, rock, blues, and soul. Often compared to Ed Sheeran and Ben Howard, Chaos and the Calm shows James Bay has the style and the ability to stand on his own, and it\'s the work of a new performer with an impressive potential.

            style: [],
            summary: `American V: A Hundred Highways is the long-awaited album of Johnny Cash's final recordings, the basic tracks for which (i.e., Cash's vocals) were recorded in 2002-2003, with overdubs added by producer Rick Rubin after his death on September 12, 2003, at age 71. Between 1994 and 2002, Cash and Rubin had succeeded in fashioning a third act for the veteran country singer's career, following his acclaimed 1950s work for Sun Records and his popular recordings for Columbia in the 1960s and '70s. In the '80s, Cash's star had faded, but Rubin reinvented him as a hip country-folk-rock elder at 62 with American Recordings (1994), his first new studio album to reach the pop charts in 18 years. Unchained (1996) and American III: Solitary Man (2000) continued the comeback, at least as far as the critics were concerned, though none of the albums was actually a big seller. But American IV: The Man Comes Around (2002), propelled by Cash's cover of Nine Inch Nails' "Hurt" and a powerful video, stayed in the pop charts longer than any Cash album since 1969's Johnny Cash at San Quentin. By 2002, however, Cash was in failing health, homebound and in a wheelchair, and he suffered a personal blow when his wife, June Carter Cash, died on May 15, 2003.  The American series, which posited Cash as an aged sage and the repository for a bottomless American songbook, had already shown a predilection for gloom in the name of gravity; it's no surprise that the fifth and final volume would be even more concerned with, as three earlier Cash compilations had put it, God, Love, and Murder. The ailing septuagenarian certainly sounds like he's near the end of his life, but that said, he doesn't sound bad. Cash was never a great singer in a technical sense: he hadn't much range, his pitch often wobbled, and his lack of breath control sometimes found him grasping for sound at the end of lines. But he was a great singer in the sense of projecting a persona through his voice; his emotional range, which went from a Sinatra-like swagger to an almost embarrassingly intimate vulnerability, was as wide as the spread of notes he could hit confidently was narrow. Such a singer doesn't really lose that much with age; in fact, he gains even more interpretive depth. Listening to this album, one can't get around the knowledge that it is a posthumous collection made in Cash's last days, but even without that context, it would have much the same impact. ␍␊
            The album begins with two religious songs, Larry Gatlin's "Help Me," a plea to God, and the traditional "God's Gonna Cut You Down," which, in a sense, answers that plea. The finality of death thus established, Cash launches into what is billed as the last song he ever wrote, "Like the 309," which is about a train taking his casket away. The same image is used later in the cover of Hank Williams' "On the Evening Train," in which a man and his child put the coffin of a wife and mother on another train. Cash sings these songs in a restrained manner, and even has a sense of humor in "Like the 309," in which he complains about his asthma: "It should be awhile/Before I see Doctor Death/So it would sure be nice/If I could get my breath." In between the two train songs come songs that may not have been about death when their authors wrote them, but sure sound like they are here. As written, Gordon Lightfoot's "If You Could Read My Mind" seems to concern a romantic breakup expressed in literary and cinematic terms, but in Cash's voice, lines like "You know that ghost is me" and "But stories always end" become inescapably elegiac. Bruce Springsteen's "Further On (Up the Road)" is even easier to interpret as a call to the hereafter, with lines like "Got on my dead man's suit and my smilin' skull ring/My lucky graveyard boots and song to sing." These two songs make a pair with the album's two closing songs. Ian Tyson's "Four Strong Winds" is, like the Lightfoot selection, a folk standard by a Canadian songwriter, also nominally about romantic dissolution, although here the singer who is "bound for moving on" doesn't seem likely to come back. And the closing song, "I'm Free from the Chain Gang Now," may have lyrics implying that the unjustly imprisoned narrator has been set free, but in Cash's voice it sounds like he's been executed instead and is singing from beyond the grave. The four songs in between "On the Evening Train" and "Four Strong Winds," dealing with faith and love (the former expressed in a previously recorded 1984 Cash copyright, "I Came to Believe"), are weaker than what surrounds them, but they serve to complete the picture. And it's worth noting that Cash at death's door still outsings croaking Rod McKuen on the songwriter's ever-cloying "Love's Been Good to Me." Cash may never have heard Rubin's overdubs, but they are restrained and tasteful, never doing anything more than to support the singer and the song. If the entire series of American recordings makes for a fitting finale to a great career, American V: A Hundred Highways is a more than respectable coda. ~William Ruhlmann`,

            summary: 'Coldplay finally surrender to their essential good nature on Mylo Xyloto, their fifth album and first to ditch all pretense of brooding melancholia. Which isn’t to say the band doesn’t drift along on some pleasingly spacy atmospheres conjured by longtime producer Brian Eno: there’s still a veneer of classy disaffection that inevitably dissipates due to the relentless sunniness of Chris Martin and company. Eno\'s echoes and ambience -- the only things that still mark Coldplay as anything resembling progressive -- positively sparkle when they meet the band’s bright, chipper melodies, yet Coldplay\'s innate good manners restrain the album, keeping it just this side of a rush of candied pop. Such politeness can verge on the dull -- criminally so when they bring Rihanna in for “Princess of China,” a duet so toothless she may as well have stayed home -- but Mylo Xyloto has a leg up on other Coldplay records for this simple reason: they’re no longer attempting to mimic U2\'s portentous piety. They’ve embraced their schoolboy selves and are simply singing songs of love and good cheer, albeit on a grand scale that somehow seems smaller due to the group’s insuppressible niceness. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

            summary: 'Guns N\' Roses\' debut, Appetite for Destruction was a turning point for hard rock in the late \'80s -- it was a dirty, dangerous, and mean record in a time when heavy metal meant nothing but a good time. On the surface, Guns N\' Roses may appear to celebrate the same things as their peers -- namely, sex, liquor, drugs, and rock & roll -- but there is a nasty edge to their songs, since Axl Rose doesn\'t see much fun in the urban sprawl of L.A. and its parade of heavy metal thugs, cheap women, booze, and crime. The music is as nasty as the lyrics, wallowing in a bluesy, metallic hard rock borrowed from Aerosmith, AC/DC, and countless faceless hard rock bands of the early \'80s. It\'s a primal, sleazy sound that adds grit to already grim tales. It also makes Rose\'s misogyny, fear, and anger hard to dismiss as merely an artistic statement; this is music that sounds lived-in. And that\'s exactly why Appetite for Destruction is such a powerful record -- not only does Rose have fears, but he also is vulnerable, particularly on the power ballad "Sweet Child O\' Mine." He also has a talent for conveying the fears and horrors of the decaying inner city, whether it\'s on the charging "Welcome to the Jungle," the heroin ode "Mr. Brownstone," or "Paradise City," which simply wants out. But as good as Rose\'s lyrics and screeching vocals are, they wouldn\'t be nearly as effective without the twin-guitar interplay of Slash and Izzy Stradlin, who spit out riffs and solos better than any band since the Rolling Stones, and that\'s what makes Appetite for Destruction the best metal record of the late \'80s.

            summary: 'Off the Wall was a massive success, spawning four Top Ten hits (two of them number ones), but nothing could have prepared Michael Jackson for Thriller. Nobody could have prepared anybody for the success of Thriller, since the magnitude of its success was simply unimaginable -- an album that sold 40 million copies in its initial chart run, with seven of its nine tracks reaching the Top Ten (for the record, the terrific "Baby Be Mine" and the pretty good ballad "The Lady in My Life" are not like the others). This was a record that had something for everybody, building on the basic blueprint of Off the Wall by adding harder funk, hard rock, softer ballads, and smoother soul -- expanding the approach to have something for every audience. That alone would have given the album a good shot at a huge audience, but it also arrived precisely when MTV was reaching its ascendancy, and Jackson helped the network by being not just its first superstar, but first black star as much as the network helped him. This all would have made it a success (and its success, in turn, served as a new standard for success), but it stayed on the charts, turning out singles, for nearly two years because it was really, really good. True, it wasn\'t as tight as Off the Wall -- and the ridiculous, late-night house-of-horrors title track is the prime culprit, arriving in the middle of the record and sucking out its momentum -- but those one or two cuts don\'t detract from a phenomenal set of music. It\'s calculated, to be sure, but the chutzpah of those calculations (before this, nobody would even have thought to bring in metal virtuoso Eddie Van Halen to play on a disco cut) is outdone by their success. This is where a song as gentle and lovely as "Human Nature" coexists comfortably with the tough, scared "Beat It," the sweet schmaltz of the Paul McCartney duet "The Girl Is Mine," and the frizzy funk of "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)." And, although this is an undeniably fun record, the paranoia is already creeping in, manifesting itself in the record\'s two best songs: "Billie Jean," where a woman claims Michael is the father of her child, and the delirious "Wanna Be Startin\' Something," the freshest funk on the album, but the most claustrophobic, scariest track Jackson ever recorded. These give the record its anchor and are part of the reason why the record is more than just a phenomenon. The other reason, of course, is that much of this is just simply great music.

            summary: 'Maroon 5 have certainly come a long way since their days in the indie outfit Kara\'s Flowers. After the band\'s demise in 1999, frontman Adam Levine surrounded himself with New York City\'s urban hip-hop culture and found a new musical calling. Maroon 5 was born and their debut album, Songs About Jane, illustrates an impressive rebirth. It\'s groovy in spots, offering bluesy funk on "Shiver" and a catchy, soulful disposition on "Harder to Breathe." "Must Get Out" slows things down with its dreamy lyrical story, and Levine is a vocal dead ringer for Men at Work\'s Colin Hay. Don\'t wince -- it works brilliantly. Songs About Jane is love-drunk on what makes Maroon 5 tick as a band. They\'re not as glossy as the Phantom Planet darlings; they\'ve got grit and a sexy strut, personally and musically. It\'s much too slick to cross over commercially in 2002, but it\'s good enough for the pop kids to take notice.

            summary: 'If Definitely Maybe was an unintentional concept album about wanting to be a rock & roll star, (What\'s the Story) Morning Glory? is what happens after the dreams come true. Oasis turns in a relatively introspective second record, filled with big, gorgeous ballads instead of ripping rockers. Unlike Definitely Maybe, the production on Morning Glory is varied enough to handle the range in emotions; instead of drowning everything with amplifiers turned up to 12, there are strings, keyboards, and harmonicas. This expanded production helps give Noel Gallagher\'s sweeping melodies an emotional resonance that he occasionally can\'t convey lyrically. However, that is far from a fatal flaw; Gallagher\'s lyrics work best in fragments, where the images catch in your mind and grow, thanks to the music. Gallagher may be guilty of some borrowing, or even plagiarism, but he uses the familiar riffs as building blocks. This is where his genius lies: He\'s a thief and doesn\'t have many original thoughts, but as a pop/rock melodicist he\'s pretty much without peer. Likewise, as musicians, Oasis are hardly innovators, yet they have a majestic grandeur in their sound that makes ballads like "Wonderwall" or rockers like "Some Might Say" positively transcendent. Alan White does add authority to the rhythm section, but the most noticeable change is in Liam Gallagher. His voice sneered throughout Definitely Maybe, but on Morning Glory his singing has become more textured and skillful. He gives the lyric in the raging title track a hint of regret, is sympathetic on "Wonderwall," defiant on "Some Might Say," and humorous on "She\'s Electric," a bawdy rewrite of "Digsy\'s Diner." It might not have the immediate impact of Definitely Maybe, but Morning Glory is just as exciting and compulsively listenable.

            summary: 'If Day at the Races was a sleek, streamlined album, its 1977 successor, News of the World, was its polar opposite, an explosion of styles that didn\'t seem to hold to any particular center. It\'s front-loaded with two of Queen\'s biggest anthems -- the stomping, stadium-filling chant "We Will Rock You" and its triumphant companion, "We Are the Champions" -- which are quickly followed by the ferocious "Sheer Heart Attack," a frenzied rocker that hits harder than anything on the album that shares its name (a remarkable achievement in itself). Three songs, three quick shifts in mood, but that\'s hardly the end of it. As the News rolls on, you\'re treated to the arch, campy crooning of "My Melancholy Blues," a shticky blues shuffle in "Sleeping on the Sidewalk," and breezy Latin rhythms on "Who Needs You." Then there\'s the neo-disco of "Fight from the Inside," which is eclipsed by the mechanical funk of "Get Down, Make Love," a dirty grind that\'s stripped of sensuality. That cold streak on "Get Down, Make Love" runs through the album as a whole. Despite the explosion of sounds and rhythms, this album doesn\'t add up to party thanks to that slightly distancing chilly vibe that hangs over the album. Nevertheless, many of these songs work well on their own as entities, so there is plenty to savor here, especially from Brian May. Whether he\'s doing the strangely subdued eccentric English pop "All Dead, All Dead" or especially the majestic yet nimble rocker "It\'s Late," he turns in work that gives this album some lightness, which it needs. And that\'s the reason News of the World was a monster hit despite its coldness -- when it works, it\'s massive, earth-shaking rock & roll, the sound of a band beginning to revel in its superstardom. [A 1994 digital version added a bonus mix of "We Will Rock You."] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine',

            summary: 'The Rolling Stones finally delivered a set of all-original material with Aftermath, which also did much to define the group as the bad boys of rock & roll, with their sneering attitude toward the world in general and the female sex in particular. The borderline misogyny could get a bit juvenile in tunes like "Stupid Girl." But on the other hand the group began incorporating the influences of psychedelia and Dylan into their material with classics like "Paint It, Black," an eerily insistent number one hit graced by some of the best use of sitar (played by Brian Jones) on a rock record. Other classics included the jazzy "Under My Thumb," where Jones added exotic accents with his vibes, and the delicate Elizabethan ballad "Lady Jane," where dulcimer can be heard. Some of the material is fairly ho-hum, to be honest, as Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were still prone to inconsistent songwriting; "Goin\' Home," an 11-minute blues jam, was remarkable, more for its barrier-crashing length than its content. Look out for an obscure gem, however, in the brooding, meditative "I Am Waiting." [This is the Japanese edition of the CD.] ~ Richie Unterberger',

            summary: 'Mostly recorded without Brian Jones -- who died several months before its release (although he does play on two tracks) and was replaced by Mick Taylor (who also plays on just two songs) -- Let It Bleed extends the rock and blues feel of Beggars Banquet into slightly harder-rocking, more demonically sexual territory. The Rolling Stones were never as consistent on album as their main rivals, the Beatles, and Let It Bleed suffers from some rather perfunctory tracks, like "Monkey Man" and a countrified remake of the classic "Honky Tonk Woman" (here titled "Country Honk"). Yet some of the songs are among their very best, especially "Gimme Shelter," with its shimmering guitar lines and apocalyptic lyrics; the harmonica-driven "Midnight Rambler"; the druggy party ambience of the title track; and the stunning "You Can\'t Always Get What You Want," which was the Stones\' "Hey Jude" of sorts, with its epic structure, horns, philosophical lyrics, and swelling choral vocals. "You Got the Silver" (Keith Richards\' first lead vocal) and Robert Johnson\'s "Love in Vain," by contrast, were as close to the roots of acoustic down-home blues as the Stones ever got. ~ Richie Unterberger',

            summary: 'The anthemic indie rock sound of Snow Patrol provides a bit of hope and promise among the many acts attempting to fit into a certain genre or scene. Snow Patrol belongs to their own scene, and their third album, 2004\'s Final Straw, proved that with several global hit singles such as "Run," "Chocolate," "How to Be Dead," and the reissue of "Spitting Games." British fans once more proclaimed their beloved Snow Patrol as a true rock & roll band while American audiences finally took notice of the Scottish collective. The band\'s fourth album, Eyes Open, doesn\'t fall short from where they left off; in fact, Snow Patrol\'s hungry rock sound only gets bigger and better this time around. All guitar hooks and singalong choruses are firmly in place. Gary Lightbody is an underrated frontman. On Eyes Open, he once again writes songs that are from the heart and true to self-reflection without getting too sappy and too overjoyed. From the playful name-dropping of Sufjan Stevens on "Hands Open" to their passionate delivery on "It\'s Beginning to Get to Me" and "Shut Your Eyes," Snow Patrol\'s approach is epic. They are the kind of band that embraces simplicity as beautiful and human flaws as art. The lullaby-like "You Could Be Happy" and the passionate buildup of "Make This Go on Forever" are evident of that. This 11-song set is a masterpiece, so keep your ears and eyes open for Snow Patrol. They\'re onto something big. ~ MacKenzie Wilson',

            summary: 'The Strokes sound like they have a lot to prove on Room on Fire, not to their naysayers, but to themselves. From the sneakily addictive, new wave-tinged "12:51" to "Automatic Stop"\'s loping reggae beat to "Under Control"\'s \'60s soul homage, the band explores sounds never dreamed of on their debut. Though the Strokes recapture some of Is This It\'s exuberance on "You Talk Way Too Much" and "Meet Me in the Bathroom," songs like "The End Has No End," which repeats its title in a surprisingly affecting way, are the most memorable. Room on Fire shows that even after all that happened to the Strokes, they can still surprise. ~ Heather Phares',

Between the two albums, there\'s a fair amount of excellent material not featured on The Very Best of Chic, such as "São Paulo" (a breezy instrumental), "Chic Cheer" (more than a mere mood setter for the second album), and "At Last I Am Free" (a gorgeous quiet storm gem covered by Robert Wyatt). ~ Andy Kellman',

          summary: 'Just one listen to Adam Green & Binki Shapiro is enough to become enchanted. With deceptively pretty arrangements that echo filigreed late-sixties folk-pop and an easygoing rapport between singers, this duets collaboration may seem like the perfect accompaniment to a sunny summer’s day, Southern-California style. But it works even better as a comforting soundtrack at the end of a dark, lonely night in the big city. The atmosphere the pair conjures up with strummed guitars and discreet layers of synths indeed suggests romantic possibility, but the lyrics are more sweetly melancholic, gently but candidly addressing betrayal, incipient heartbreak, and conjugal discord. It’s an approach that makes for compelling repeated listening, as the intimate dramas reveal themselves, and it’s one that surprised even Green and Shapiro as their debut album together began to take shape.',

Among numerous other honours, they received the Ivor Novello Award for "Outstanding Service to British Music" in 2006.

          summary: `Brandon Robbins, often referred to as The Flame, and Mark Garbett, commensurately dubbed The Moth, first met on a train ride through the Alaskan outback. It's said that Mark was humming some indistinct tune while Brandon, seated rowed the opposite of his tall passenger-companion, feverishly scribed words into a moleskin. A few measures into his tune, respectively a few stanzas into his quatrain, Mark's and Brandon's efforts reached a pinnacle of symbiosis. Mark's vocal modulations and Brandon's muttered assonance's suddenly fell into a perfect rhythm. Slowly they turned to look at one another, their eyes wide. There was struck the ongoing friendship between these two. Musically, it never stopped. Together they agreed to leave their wonderland of lumber-jacking to pursue a musical career.␊
          Leaving their bucolic ice-land, they trekked to Provo, Utah with only their feet to carry them. The result of their 11 month journey to Utah Valley was a renewed sense of wonder and enough know-how to get them a weekly slot at the local open mic.␊
          It didn't take long for word of their matching hair and musical prowess to spread and soon The Moth & The Flame had officially formed.`,

          summary: 'Bibio is Stephen James Wilkinson from Wolverhampton, England. Wilkinson studied \'Sonic Arts\' between 1999 - 2002 at Middlesex University in North London, it was during this time in London he came up with the name Bibio. The name was taken from a small black and red fishing fly which was favoured by his father on their fishing trips to Wales during Stephen\'s childhood, the name therefore has nostalgic meaning which is often a theme in his music. His recording career as Bibio started with Mush records in 2004. His Mush releases consist of 3 albums and 1 EP. In 2009 he signed to Warp records and so far has released a further 2 albums, an EP containing remix contributions from other artists and several singles. Bibio\'s music combines electronic and acoustic/traditional instruments, his main instrument being guitar. Bibio\'s signature \'grainy\' sound is partly due to the use of analogue tape and vintage recording equipment, which is more exaggerated in his earlier Mush releases. Wilkinson himself labeled his debut on Mush as "Saturated Folk". Bibio\'s recent output, particularly on Warp, has been more diverse, with an increasing use of his own vocals, drums/beats and electronics. His Mush debut \'Fi\' was described by Marcus Eoin of Boards of Canada as: "The antidote to the modern laptopia of pristine electronic music...". In 2009, Bibio contributed a cover version of Boards of Canada\'s \'Kaini Industries\' to the Warp 20th Anniversary \'Recreated\' album. Read more on Last.fm.

Rob Schneider (of The Apples in Stereo), Will Cullen Hart, Bill Doss (formerly of Olivia Tremor Control and now comprising Circulatory System and The Sunshine Fix, respectively) and Mangum all attended the same high school in Ruston, Louisiana in the late 1980\'s. The friends shared a passion for bands of the 60\'s such as The Beach Boys, The Beatles, and The Zombies, as well as an affinity for newer, noisier bands such as Sonic Youth and Minutemen. They reflected these influences in the tapes they recorded and shared with each other, forming the seeds of what would become the Elephant Six Collective. While Robert Schneider became the "popular" face of the collective with the eventual success of The Apples in Stereo, Mangum would ultimately release some of the collective\'s most interesting and enduringly popular music.',

          Nico started a successful career as a model in Berlin and Paris, studied acting at Lee Strasberg's New York Actor Studio. She then became part of the Swinging London scene, and had a short relationship with The Rolling Stones' Brian Jones and she recorded her first record in London in 1965, the single I'm Not Saying/The Last Mile, produced by Jimmy Page, for Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham's label Immediate Records. Thanks to Jones she met Andy Warhol in New York City and became part of Warhol's Factory, and Warhol introduced her to the Rock band The Velvet Underground, with whom she recorded the album "The Velvet Underground & Nico", featuring the legendary banana cover designed by Andy Warhol. The album has been named by numerous publications as one of the top 100 albums of all time, and is often considered one of history's 10 most influential albums by critics.`,

          summary: 'Brian Peter George St John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno, (b. 15 May 1948), professionally known as Brian Eno or simply as Eno, is an English musician, composer, record producer, singer, music theorist and visual artist, and is commonly referred to as the father of ambient music. Born in Suffolk, Eno attended art school in Ipswich in the late 1960s, where he studied under Roy Ascott and took inspiration from minimalist painting, cybernetics, and experimental music techniques. Eno has frequently been described as one of popular music\'s most important and influential figures. A self-described \'non-musician\', Eno has helped to pioneer a variety of novel studio production techniques and approaches, playing an important role in the development of ambient, electronic, worldbeat, chance, and generative music styles. He continues to release music, produce, and write, and maintains a regular column in Prospect Magazine.',

          summary: `Oberhofer started in 2008 as the recording project of Brad Oberhofer. After moving from his native Tacoma, Washington to New York City, Oberhofer attended New York University to study music composition.[1] In the style of Jon Bon Jovi, the young singer adopted his own name as the title of the project. Although the band has since gone through various lineup formations, the name has remained the same because Oberhofer writes and records all the music himself.[2]␊
          In 2010, Oberhofer self-released his first single o0Oo0O0o and was soon asked to go on tour with bands like Sleigh Bells, Neon Indian, and The Morning Benders.[1] After hitting the road for a year, Oberhofer released Away Frm U and I Could Go in 2011. The two singles brought the attention of independent label White Iris Records who released the band's next single Gotta Go/Mahwun in the summer of 2011. Soon after, Oberhofer signed with Glassnote Records to release their debut album.[3] Stereogum ranked the band as the No. 39 most anticipated album of 2012.[4]␊
          Brad began work on Time Capsules II in the studio with Grammy Award winning producer Steve Lillywhite in November 2011, recording vocals and most instrumental tracks himself, and pulling in bandmates and other instrumentalists to complete certain tracks. Glassnote released Time Capsules II on in the United States on March 27, 2012.[5] In anticipation for the release, the band performed "Away Frm U" on the Late Show with David Letterman.[6]␊
          Oberhofer performed widely in clubs and on the festival circuit in support of Time Capsules II. Recent notable performances include in the Mojave Tent at the 2012 edition of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.[7] and the Budweiser stage at Lollapalooza in Chicago on August 5, 2012,.[8] They are scheduled to perform at the Austin City Limits Music Festival on October 13.[9]␊
          They are currently on tour with Matt & Kim from 9/16-11/17. Read more on Last.fm. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply`,

          summary: 'English singer/songwriter Andrew "Roo" Panes\' introspective lyrics, soulful voice, and deft fingerpicking have drawn comparisons to artists like Nick Drake, George Ezra, and Laura Marling. He issued his first EP, Once, in 2012 and stayed loyal to a hushed, acoustic palette across subsequent releases, including his full-length debut, 2014\'s Little Giant.  Born into an artistic family in Wimborne, Dorset, Panes earned his Hundred Acre Wood-inspired nickname after falling into a river as a child, much like Winnie the Pooh did during a heated game of Poohsticks. Panes released his first in a series of well-received independent EPs, Once, in 2012, the same year he gained exposure via a campaign for luxury British fashion house Burberry. CRC Music released the EPs Weight of Your World and Land of the Living in 2012 and 2013, respectively, before issuing his proper full-length debut, Little Giant, in 2014. Maintaining an intimate presence and instrumentation limited to mostly 12-string guitar, occasional piano, and strings, his sophomore studio LP, Paperweights, followed in early 2016. His next album, Quiet Man, was written and recorded in the English countryside. It saw release in 2018, also by CRC. ~ James Christopher Monger & Marcy Donelson',

          summary: 'In 2007, longtime best friends Rocky Tinder and Eric Phipps moved to Portland, Oregon and decided to start a band. With all the buoyancy and idealism of youth (being fresh out of high school at the time), and stimulated by the massive amount of creative output surrounding them in their new city, they sketched out a vision for a massive friend band  - the possibility of getting every single one of their buds on stage and creating a monumental live show. Yet both boys have discerning taste, having backgrounds in music theory from a tender age, and questioned the logistics of a chaotic set-up. Moreover, they were enamored of the freedom that local dance music outfits had with their compact set-ups, allowing these acts to show up and throw down anywhere. Accordingly, they tweaked their vision and decided to just do it themselves. Armed with two guitars and an iPod filled with their meticulously prerecorded beats, bass lines, and bells, they became Wampire – two boys on a mission to have as much fun being a dance-rock duo as 20 people combined. Now, 3 years later, with the new addition of drummer Cyrus Lampton for extra beats and extra smiles, it is very safe to say that Wampire have succeeded: this band is epically, epically fun. Whether rocking out in the dark of a nightclub, with Flashdance projected behind them from out of Tinder\'s gold-painted VCR, or stripping down to their skivvies during an afternoon parking lot performance, Wampire is a sight to behold. They\'re certainly not taking themselves too seriously, but one can say a lot more than that about their live show. Their easy chemistry and inexhaustible joviality is totally infectious – you\'re powerless to resist the dance floor when they take the stage. They\'ve also managed, in a rare feat these days, to wed onstage antics with bonafide musicianship, earning them love from musicians, critics, and fans all over Portland. From their delightful re-invention of Kraftwerk\'s “Das model,” sung impeccably in German by Phipps over a sleek synth-pop landscape, to original jewels like “Hyphy shred” which boasts soaring guitars and blissed-out glitchiness, their work would be right at home amongst the current Chillwave phenomenon made popular by Neon Indian, Washed Out, Small Black, etc. Yet don\'t be confused into thinking that their bliss is purely aesthetic, for there is no too-cool posturing when it comes to Wamp-Wamp, as Wampire is often affectionately called around town. Their aesthetic arose organically, out of the stoner/skater/slacker subculture to which they belong, having built a fanbase from the basement up via Portland\'s vibrant house show scene. Among these roots is a stint living, working, and curating all-ages shows at the legendary now-defunct downtown Portland performance space The Hush. Now, they\'re considered one of the staples of Portland\'s dance/electronic scene, sharing bills with local greats like Starfucker, Reporter, and Glass Candy.  Read more on Last.fm.

          summary: 'Kraftwerk ("power plant" in English) is an electronic band founded in 1970 in Düsseldorf, Germany. They pioneered electronic music in the 70s and are considered one of the most important and influential bands of their genre, often described as "the godfathers of electronic music". Kraftwerk\'s sound is minimalistic and strictly electronic; it combines driving, repetitive rhythms with catchy melodies and vocals usually sung through a vocoder. The current line-up consists of Ralf Hütter (the only original member), Fritz Hilpert, Henning Schmitz and Stefan Pfaffe. The other founding member Florian Schneider left the band in 2008.',

          summary: `Liars is an Experimental Electro/Rock band formed in 2000. Australian-born Angus Andrew is the founding and only constant member with Aaron Hemphill (percussion, guitar, synth) leaving the project in 2017 and Julian Gross (drums) no longer is able to perform due to personal reasons. The band have released 8 studio albums since forming and remain to be one of the few bands remain to be consistently active from the Post-Punk Revival scene in New York of 2000s.␊
           ␊
          Although initially lumped into the New York dance-punk scene of the early 21st century, they have come to be categorized by their dramatic stylistic shifts between albums, while retaining a consistent interest in rhythm and sound texture. Liars are one of the many contemporary bands to draw from the late 1970's British post-punk movement. Their first album, 2002's They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument on Top, bore some resemblance to the work of Delta 5 and Gang of Four, accenting their angular, acerbic punk with modern synths and drum machines. Liar's second album, 2004's They Were Wrong, So We Drowned, eschewed their debut's trendy post-punk aesthetic in favor of dissonant atmospherics and electronic soundscapes more akin to the sound of This Heat. That album stratified fans and critics alike, especially chafing with those who took to They Threw Us All for the clear dance/punk leanings of a number of that album's tracks (e.g. "We Live Northeast of Compton"). 2006 saw the release of Drum's Not Dead., which continued the direction they had taken with They Were Wrong but was met with a much more favorable critical reaction. 2007's self-tited LP, Liars, found the band once again shifting styles, this time towards 60's style garage rock and 70's proto-punk, all through the dark, effects-driven prism that Liars began channeling on They Were Wrong. While more straight-forward than their previous 2 LPs, the record contained the same focus on rhythm and experimentation with the deconstruction of traditional sounds. Similar to Drum's Not Dead, Liars was critically praised and found its way on to Best of 2007 lists. They released, Sisterworld, in 2010, which continued in their experimental post-punk direction. Its deluxe edition came with a completely remixed version of the album, with tracks being remixed by artists such as Thom Yorke, Kazu Makino of Blonde Redhead and Carter Tutti. In 2012, they released WIXIW, which saw the band take an almost entirely electronic direction with their music. Their seventh album, Mess, is currently slated to be released in March 2014.`,

          summary: `Max Frost is a producer and songwriter from Austin, TX signed to Atlantic Records.␊
          Frost developed his eclectic style of music playing in various projects throughout his teen years. He became a musician when he was eight, and started playing shows at 12, collaborating with a diverse array of artists like Austin icon Bob Schneider and hip-hop MC/producer Kydd. After hearing musicians like Erykah Badu and D’Angelo in his late teens, Frost began incorporating hip-hop elements into his blues-inspired stylings, interested in the idea of combining modern rhythms with classic vintage tones in his music.␊
          In September 2012 Frost decided to leave the University of Texas-Austin, where he was studying English, to pursue his solo career. He released a single, “White Lies,” which hit No. 1 on The Hype Machine’s “Most Popular Tracks on Blogs Now.” Max channeled the song’s success into the creation of his debut EP, Low High Low, which was released in October 2013 by Atlantic Records.␊
          Frost has stated that “The songs all connect to polar emotional states in life – highs and lows – giving the EP its name.” The theme continues in the production aesthetics of low-fi and high-fi, which continues as the basic concept in his music.␊
          In December 2013, "White Lies" was featured in a commercial for Beats Electronics.`,

          summary: `English rock combo Band of Skulls rose to prominence in the early 2010s, crafting bluesy and gritty slabs of atmospheric indie rock that echoed the work of contemporaries like the Kills, Duke Spirit, and the Black Keys. While their 2009 debut helped put them on the map, it was albums like Sweet Sour (2012) and Himalayan (2014) that earned them a widespread international following and a major-label contract for 2016's By Default.␊
          Formed by Russell Marsden (guitar and vocals), Emma Richardson (bass and vocals), and Matt Hayward (drums) while attending college in the city of Southampton, the band (which was originally called Fleeing New York) recorded a buzz-worthy demo in 2008, which resulted in its full-length debut album, Baby Darling Doll Face Honey, in 2009 and an accompanying international tour. For their second album, the band decamped to Wales' Rockfield Studios to work with producer Ian Davenport (Supergrass, Badly Drawn Boy). The results of those sessions, Sweet Sour, was released in February 2012 and contained the crunchy single "The Devil Takes Care of His Own," which had been a minor hit in Canada the previous year. The first material from their next album, produced by Nick Launay, appeared in the form of the riff-based single "Asleep at the Wheel" in January 2014. Himalayan, the accompanying full-length, was issued that spring. ␊
          After signing with BMG, Band of Skulls issued the fiery single "So Good," which preceded the release of their fourth studio long-player By Default, which dropped in May 2016. It would prove to be their last release with Hayward, who left the band in early 2017. Marsden and Richardson carried on as a duo using session drummers, then returned to the studio with producer Richard X (Goldfrapp, Pet Shop Boys) to record 2019's Love Is All You Love. ~ James Christopher Monger & James Wilkinson`,

          summary: `The story of Big Scary begins in 2006, when Melbourne duo Tom Iansek (#1 Dads) and Jo Syme, armed with just acoustic guitars and egg shakers, started playing songs together in the living room of Jo’s parents’ house. After a bit of a break, the two reconvened in 2008, this time with more instruments—electric guitars, drums, piano, mandolins and ukuleles—and a bolder, more expansive vision. What began as a few rainy day acoustic ballads in their first incarnation soon grew into an all-encompassing, genre-defying sound. Before long, the newly named Big Scary were writing anything they pleased—fuzzed-out garage rock; piano-led pop; intricate, pastoral instrumentals—each imbued with an effortless pop sensibility and lightness of touch that would quickly see the duo attract a strong following.␊
           ␊
          These gifts translated onto the stage where, from the outset, Big Scary proved themselves a remarkably fluid and compelling live act, capable of not only bringing their songs to life, but also of adapting their set to suit the moment.␊
           ␊
          In late 2008, the band headed into the studio for the first time, laying down six live tracks in a single day. Another quick-fire recording session soon after resulted in a four-track mini-EP, led by the towering single ‘This Weight’. Featuring Iansek’s huge distorted guitar and high-wire vocals backed by Syme’s thumping drums, ‘This Weight’ quickly caught the ears of the press, who hailed this ‘talented and fearless’ new duo.␊
           ␊
          Inspired by a wave of severe weather that hit the country, Big Scary went on to release the six-track ‘At The Mercy of The Elements’ ep. Ranging from rousing, piano-led ballads (‘Falling Away’), to thumping, distorted numbers (‘Hey Somebody’) and intricate, sonorous instrumentals (‘At The Mercy of the Elements’), the ep was a full-to-bursting showcase of the duo’s vital, dexterous sound. ‘Thoroughly excellent,’ raved The Australian. ‘Packed with anxiety and bravado,’ Beat said.␊
           ␊
          With a growing national profile, Big Scary embarked on a period of heavy touring, with a diverse list of supports that reflected the duo’s eclectic output: The Vasco Era, Florence and the Machine, Midlake, Little Red, Editors. Soon enough the duo began headlining their own shows, first in their hometown of Melbourne and then all over the country.␊
           ␊
          Big Scary remain endlessly fascinated by the natural world. In 2010, the duo released four seasonally themed, limited-edition eps, which were eventually collected as The Big Scary Four Seasons. A rich, thrillingly diverse set of songs, The Four Seasons showcased Iansek and Syme’s uncanny ability to translate the vagaries and glories of the elements into utterly compelling music.␊
           ␊
          ‘Four Seasons proves to be the defining turning point for Big Scary, for they are no longer the next best thing in Australian music, they are the best thing,' Beat Magazine said of the lp, while the AU Review hailed ‘the versatility and obscene… talent of the players.’␊
          A national tour followed, with the band playing to packed houses all over the country. Several months later, as the band began to ready their new album, ‘Autumn’, one of the standout tracks from the Four Seasons, was placed in a high-profile AT&amp;T ad in the US, introducing the band to American audiences for the first time.␊
           ␊
          The vision for the new record came together on a small island farm, where Iansek and Syme holed up for several weeks after a run of successful summer festival shows, writing and demoing songs. ‘We knew we had a lot of songs that we liked, but they were all so far from each other on the genre scale—super bratty garage, really poppy piano stuff, epic guitar songs, folky acoustic stuff,’ Syme says. ‘The album will still have elements of all that, but we've got some really strong tracks that we think tie it all together.’`,

          summary: 'Jape is the alter-ego of Redneck Manifesto member Richie Egan. Hailing from Crumlin in Dublin, Ireland, he purveys an electronica-heavy music tinged with \'stoner folk\'. Jape\'s most renowned song \'Floating\' has been covered by The Raconteurs and The Mighty Stef, to name a few. His debut album \'Cosmosphere\' was released in 2003 (Volta Records), followed by 2004\'s \'The Monkeys In The Zoo Have More Fun Than Me\' (Trust Me I\'m A Thief). Having recently signed with V2 Records (9th May 2007), a third effort \'Ritual\' came out on the 4th June 2008. The single \'Phil Lynott\' was pushed forward as a possible Christmas number one in Ireland but barely dent the charts, despite being a huge live favourite. His debut at the SXSW festival in Texas (2007) added much hype and excitement to the future prospects of Jape\'s career. In December 2008 Jape wrote a song with David Kitt for a Christmas compilation called \'An Indiecater Christmas\' which was put out by Indiecater Records. \'Ritual\' recently won the 2008 Choice Music Award.

          summary: 'David Karsten Daniels is a Dallas-based songwriter by way of Alabama, North Carolina, Oregon, and San Francisco whose music relays a personal history of diverse musical experiences - among them, a childhood of hymn singing, membership of a high school jazz band, and a formal university training in composition, theory, free improvisation, and performance art. For several years, David travelled throughout Texas and France recording quietly in small rooms, where his formal training began to give way to four-track experimentation, juxtaposing the phase pieces and improvisation of his academic life with lo-fi acoustic compositions. This itinerant approach to recording produced his first two albums (\'The Mayflower\' 2000; \'Out From Under Ligne 4\', 2001) , which employ the use of whatever (non)instruments were at hand, such as dropped coins and pencil scratches in place of drum kits, or lyrics composed by rearranging the contents of the daily newspaper.',

          summary: `Local Natives (formerly cavil at rest) is an indie rock band based in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, CA, United States.␊
          After the three founding members originally met in high school, a bassist and a drummer were found, and they all moved to a house in Silver Lake in 2008 to record their album. Their debut album as Local Natives, "Gorilla Manor", was released in the UK on November 2nd, 2009, and saw a US release date of February 16th, 2010. The band's sound has been described as "afropop-influenced guitars with hyperactive drumming and hooky three-part harmonies". They started to attract the attention of the music press after playing nine shows at the 2009 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. Initial reviews of Local Natives have drawn favourable comparisons to Arcade Fire, Fleet Foxes and Vampire Weekend.`,

          summary: `The Antlers are an indie rock band currently based in Brooklyn, New York, fronted by Peter Silberman. Initially, The Antlers was a solo project created by vocalist and guitarist Silberman immediately after he had moved to Brooklyn, New York, in 2007. Silberman wrote the first two albums, "Uprooted" and "In the Attic of the Universe" by himself and under his own name. Afterwards, he recruited Lerner and Cicci, becoming a collaborative group. The band recorded two EPs: "Cold War" and "New York Hospitals". Silberman's collection of songs (which was mentioned as an "elegy for his planned disappearance") would later become a full-length album titled "Hospice" and would feature an epic storyline, telling the story of an abusive relationship through an allegory of a hospice worker losing a patient—for whom he developed feelings for—to bone cancer. Silberman has stated that the album is mostly auto-biographical. The album was independently released by the band in March of 2009, selling an apparently overwhelming number of copies, later selling all of their stock and had to produce more. The band later commented that they had "bit off more than they could chew". The album received critical praise for both its narrative and musicianship and has since been listed on several "Album of the Year" lists. The band later signed with New York-based French Kiss Records. The label released a remastered "Hospice" on August 18, 2009. In 2011, they released "Burst Apart," their follow-up to "Hospice." The album was received with critical acclaim equal to its predecessor, and the band subsequently launched a world tour in support of the record.␊
          They released the (together) EP shortly after Burst Apart which contained 8 remixes and covers with several collaberating artists.␊
          In 2012 the Undersea EP was released containing 4 new songs. ␊
          On March 31th 2014 the band announced the 5th studio album called "Familiars". It was released on June 17th 2014 receiving critical acclaim worldwide.`,

          summary: 'Chicago punk rockers, circus act, and marching band Mucca Pazza formed on a principle that many musicians shun out of hand: band geeks are awesome. In fact, much of Mucca Pazza\'s appeal comes from their wholehearted acceptance -- even celebration -- of the band nerd identity. The 30-piece group includes standard marching band fare like saxophones, sousaphone, trumpets, trombones, and drums in addition to less common elements like accordion, guitar, violin, and designated cheerleaders. Taking to the stage in intentionally mismatched thrift-store band uniforms, Mucca Pazza perform repertoire including rearranged rock tunes, traditional Czech folk songs, original compositions, and other strange bedfellows too numerous to name. Band director Mark Messing first invited instrumentalist friends to meet up in Chicago\'s industrial district to play, hoping to create a "marching band culture nostalgia group." More and more musicians continued to arrive for auditions, until the band had swollen to its current epic size. Building up interest and curiosity through word of mouth alone, Mucca Pazza began performing in local bars and clubs. Though it took some time, concert attendees eventually started to outnumber musicians. Performance venues themselves began to compete with the band for oddness, and have included public parks, the stage of Late Night with Conan O\'Brien, and canoes floating down the Chicago River. In 2007 Mucca Pazza filled a bus and took to the road for their first-ever tour, following the recording of their debut EP, the 30-minute A Little Marching Band. Plans were in the works for more touring and a full-length album to be released in 2008.',

            summary: 'Just one listen to Adam Green & Binki Shapiro is enough to become enchanted. With deceptively pretty arrangements that echo filigreed late-sixties folk-pop and an easygoing rapport between singers, this duets collaboration may seem like the perfect accompaniment to a sunny summer’s day, Southern-California style. But it works even better as a comforting soundtrack at the end of a dark, lonely night in the big city. The atmosphere the pair conjures up with strummed guitars and discreet layers of synths indeed suggests romantic possibility, but the lyrics are more sweetly melancholic, gently but candidly addressing betrayal, incipient heartbreak, and conjugal discord. It’s an approach that makes for compelling repeated listening, as the intimate dramas reveal themselves, and it’s one that surprised even Green and Shapiro as their debut album together began to take shape.',

            summary: 'The Kinks (1963–1996; 2018-present) are an English pop-rock group that came out of the British R&amp;B scene of the early 1960s. Formed in Muswell Hill, North London, by brothers Ray Davies and Dave Davies in 1964 and categorised in the United States as a "British Invasion" band, the Kinks are recognised as one of the most important and influential rock groups of the era. In 1990, their first year of eligibility, the original four members were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Later, in November 2005, they were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame. Among numerous other honours, they received the Ivor Novello Award for "Outstanding Service to British Music" in 2006. The Kinks reunited in June 2018, with the Davies brothers and drummer Mick Avory.',

His first full length, Hold A Match for a Gasoline World, released late in 2005, took "Make Right With You" and "In the End" from his EP, and expanded it to an 11 song album. Rolling Stone described the record as "a collection of songs that even the most jaded anti-folk hipster could catch himself humming on the street." He would go on to release Snow Beast in 2007.',

It's said that Mark was humming some indistinct tune while Brandon, seated rowed the opposite of his tall passenger-companion, feverishly scribed words into a moleskin. A few measures into his tune, respectively a few stanzas into his quatrain, Mark's and Brandon's efforts reached a pinnacle of symbiosis. Mark's vocal modulations and Brandon's muttered assonance's suddenly fell into a perfect rhythm. Slowly they turned to look at one another, their eyes wide. There was struck the ongoing friendship between these two. Musically, it never stopped. Together they agreed to leave their wonderland of lumber-jacking to pursue a musical career.␊
            Leaving their bucolic ice-land, they trekked to Provo, Utah with only their feet to carry them. The result of their 11 month journey to Utah Valley was a renewed sense of wonder and enough know-how to get them a weekly slot at the local open mic.␊

            summary: 'Bibio is Stephen James Wilkinson from Wolverhampton, England. Wilkinson studied \'Sonic Arts\' between 1999 - 2002 at Middlesex University in North London, it was during this time in London he came up with the name Bibio. The name was taken from a small black and red fishing fly which was favoured by his father on their fishing trips to Wales during Stephen\'s childhood, the name therefore has nostalgic meaning which is often a theme in his music. His recording career as Bibio started with Mush records in 2004. His Mush releases consist of 3 albums and 1 EP. In 2009 he signed to Warp records and so far has released a further 2 albums, an EP containing remix contributions from other artists and several singles. Bibio\'s music combines electronic and acoustic/traditional instruments, his main instrument being guitar. Bibio\'s signature \'grainy\' sound is partly due to the use of analogue tape and vintage recording equipment, which is more exaggerated in his earlier Mush releases. Wilkinson himself labeled his debut on Mush as "Saturated Folk". Bibio\'s recent output, particularly on Warp, has been more diverse, with an increasing use of his own vocals, drums/beats and electronics. His Mush debut \'Fi\' was described by Marcus Eoin of Boards of Canada as: "The antidote to the modern laptopia of pristine electronic music...". In 2009, Bibio contributed a cover version of Boards of Canada\'s \'Kaini Industries\' to the Warp 20th Anniversary \'Recreated\' album. Read more on Last.fm.

Rob Schneider (of The Apples in Stereo), Will Cullen Hart, Bill Doss (formerly of Olivia Tremor Control and now comprising Circulatory System and The Sunshine Fix, respectively) and Mangum all attended the same high school in Ruston, Louisiana in the late 1980\'s. The friends shared a passion for bands of the 60\'s such as The Beach Boys, The Beatles, and The Zombies, as well as an affinity for newer, noisier bands such as Sonic Youth and Minutemen. They reflected these influences in the tapes they recorded and shared with each other, forming the seeds of what would become the Elephant Six Collective. While Robert Schneider became the "popular" face of the collective with the eventual success of The Apples in Stereo, Mangum would ultimately release some of the collective\'s most interesting and enduringly popular music.',

            Nico started a successful career as a model in Berlin and Paris, studied acting at Lee Strasberg's New York Actor Studio. She then became part of the Swinging London scene, and had a short relationship with The Rolling Stones' Brian Jones and she recorded her first record in London in 1965, the single I'm Not Saying/The Last Mile, produced by Jimmy Page, for Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham's label Immediate Records. Thanks to Jones she met Andy Warhol in New York City and became part of Warhol's Factory, and Warhol introduced her to the Rock band The Velvet Underground, with whom she recorded the album "The Velvet Underground & Nico", featuring the legendary banana cover designed by Andy Warhol. The album has been named by numerous publications as one of the top 100 albums of all time, and is often considered one of history's 10 most influential albums by critics.`,

            summary: 'Brian Peter George St John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno, (b. 15 May 1948), professionally known as Brian Eno or simply as Eno, is an English musician, composer, record producer, singer, music theorist and visual artist, and is commonly referred to as the father of ambient music. Born in Suffolk, Eno attended art school in Ipswich in the late 1960s, where he studied under Roy Ascott and took inspiration from minimalist painting, cybernetics, and experimental music techniques. Eno has frequently been described as one of popular music\'s most important and influential figures. A self-described \'non-musician\', Eno has helped to pioneer a variety of novel studio production techniques and approaches, playing an important role in the development of ambient, electronic, worldbeat, chance, and generative music styles. He continues to release music, produce, and write, and maintains a regular column in Prospect Magazine.',

            summary: `Oberhofer started in 2008 as the recording project of Brad Oberhofer. After moving from his native Tacoma, Washington to New York City, Oberhofer attended New York University to study music composition.[1] In the style of Jon Bon Jovi, the young singer adopted his own name as the title of the project. Although the band has since gone through various lineup formations, the name has remained the same because Oberhofer writes and records all the music himself.[2]␊
            In 2010, Oberhofer self-released his first single o0Oo0O0o and was soon asked to go on tour with bands like Sleigh Bells, Neon Indian, and The Morning Benders.[1] After hitting the road for a year, Oberhofer released Away Frm U and I Could Go in 2011. The two singles brought the attention of independent label White Iris Records who released the band's next single Gotta Go/Mahwun in the summer of 2011. Soon after, Oberhofer signed with Glassnote Records to release their debut album.[3] Stereogum ranked the band as the No. 39 most anticipated album of 2012.[4]␊
            Brad began work on Time Capsules II in the studio with Grammy Award winning producer Steve Lillywhite in November 2011, recording vocals and most instrumental tracks himself, and pulling in bandmates and other instrumentalists to complete certain tracks. Glassnote released Time Capsules II on in the United States on March 27, 2012.[5] In anticipation for the release, the band performed "Away Frm U" on the Late Show with David Letterman.[6]␊
            Oberhofer performed widely in clubs and on the festival circuit in support of Time Capsules II. Recent notable performances include in the Mojave Tent at the 2012 edition of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.[7] and the Budweiser stage at Lollapalooza in Chicago on August 5, 2012,.[8] They are scheduled to perform at the Austin City Limits Music Festival on October 13.[9]␊
            They are currently on tour with Matt & Kim from 9/16-11/17. Read more on Last.fm. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply`,

            summary: 'English singer/songwriter Andrew "Roo" Panes\' introspective lyrics, soulful voice, and deft fingerpicking have drawn comparisons to artists like Nick Drake, George Ezra, and Laura Marling. He issued his first EP, Once, in 2012 and stayed loyal to a hushed, acoustic palette across subsequent releases, including his full-length debut, 2014\'s Little Giant.  Born into an artistic family in Wimborne, Dorset, Panes earned his Hundred Acre Wood-inspired nickname after falling into a river as a child, much like Winnie the Pooh did during a heated game of Poohsticks. Panes released his first in a series of well-received independent EPs, Once, in 2012, the same year he gained exposure via a campaign for luxury British fashion house Burberry. CRC Music released the EPs Weight of Your World and Land of the Living in 2012 and 2013, respectively, before issuing his proper full-length debut, Little Giant, in 2014. Maintaining an intimate presence and instrumentation limited to mostly 12-string guitar, occasional piano, and strings, his sophomore studio LP, Paperweights, followed in early 2016. His next album, Quiet Man, was written and recorded in the English countryside. It saw release in 2018, also by CRC. ~ James Christopher Monger & Marcy Donelson',

            summary: 'In 2007, longtime best friends Rocky Tinder and Eric Phipps moved to Portland, Oregon and decided to start a band. With all the buoyancy and idealism of youth (being fresh out of high school at the time), and stimulated by the massive amount of creative output surrounding them in their new city, they sketched out a vision for a massive friend band  - the possibility of getting every single one of their buds on stage and creating a monumental live show. Yet both boys have discerning taste, having backgrounds in music theory from a tender age, and questioned the logistics of a chaotic set-up. Moreover, they were enamored of the freedom that local dance music outfits had with their compact set-ups, allowing these acts to show up and throw down anywhere. Accordingly, they tweaked their vision and decided to just do it themselves. Armed with two guitars and an iPod filled with their meticulously prerecorded beats, bass lines, and bells, they became Wampire – two boys on a mission to have as much fun being a dance-rock duo as 20 people combined. Now, 3 years later, with the new addition of drummer Cyrus Lampton for extra beats and extra smiles, it is very safe to say that Wampire have succeeded: this band is epically, epically fun. Whether rocking out in the dark of a nightclub, with Flashdance projected behind them from out of Tinder\'s gold-painted VCR, or stripping down to their skivvies during an afternoon parking lot performance, Wampire is a sight to behold. They\'re certainly not taking themselves too seriously, but one can say a lot more than that about their live show. Their easy chemistry and inexhaustible joviality is totally infectious – you\'re powerless to resist the dance floor when they take the stage. They\'ve also managed, in a rare feat these days, to wed onstage antics with bonafide musicianship, earning them love from musicians, critics, and fans all over Portland. From their delightful re-invention of Kraftwerk\'s “Das model,” sung impeccably in German by Phipps over a sleek synth-pop landscape, to original jewels like “Hyphy shred” which boasts soaring guitars and blissed-out glitchiness, their work would be right at home amongst the current Chillwave phenomenon made popular by Neon Indian, Washed Out, Small Black, etc. Yet don\'t be confused into thinking that their bliss is purely aesthetic, for there is no too-cool posturing when it comes to Wamp-Wamp, as Wampire is often affectionately called around town. Their aesthetic arose organically, out of the stoner/skater/slacker subculture to which they belong, having built a fanbase from the basement up via Portland\'s vibrant house show scene. Among these roots is a stint living, working, and curating all-ages shows at the legendary now-defunct downtown Portland performance space The Hush. Now, they\'re considered one of the staples of Portland\'s dance/electronic scene, sharing bills with local greats like Starfucker, Reporter, and Glass Candy.  Read more on Last.fm.

Originally part of Cambridge University Footlights Dramatic Club, he found fame playing various roles in the classic British comedy TV series "Blackadder."

Songfacts reports that Laurie is also an enthusiastic and keen musician, playing the piano, guitar, drums, harmonica, and saxophone. He has displayed his musical talents on several episodes of House, as well as on previous shows he starred in, such as A Bit Of Fry & Laurie. In 2010 Laurie played piano as a special guest on  Meatloaf 's track If I Can't Have You.␊

They pioneered electronic music in the 70s and are considered one of the most important and influential bands of their genre, often described as "the godfathers of electronic music". Kraftwerk\'s sound is minimalistic and strictly electronic; it combines driving, repetitive rhythms with catchy melodies and vocals usually sung through a vocoder. The current line-up consists of Ralf Hütter (the only original member), Fritz Hilpert, Henning Schmitz and Stefan Pfaffe. The other founding member Florian Schneider left the band in 2008.',

            summary: `Liars is an Experimental Electro/Rock band formed in 2000. Australian-born Angus Andrew is the founding and only constant member with Aaron Hemphill (percussion, guitar, synth) leaving the project in 2017 and Julian Gross (drums) no longer is able to perform due to personal reasons. The band have released 8 studio albums since forming and remain to be one of the few bands remain to be consistently active from the Post-Punk Revival scene in New York of 2000s.␊
             ␊
            Although initially lumped into the New York dance-punk scene of the early 21st century, they have come to be categorized by their dramatic stylistic shifts between albums, while retaining a consistent interest in rhythm and sound texture. Liars are one of the many contemporary bands to draw from the late 1970's British post-punk movement. Their first album, 2002's They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument on Top, bore some resemblance to the work of Delta 5 and Gang of Four, accenting their angular, acerbic punk with modern synths and drum machines. Liar's second album, 2004's They Were Wrong, So We Drowned, eschewed their debut's trendy post-punk aesthetic in favor of dissonant atmospherics and electronic soundscapes more akin to the sound of This Heat. That album stratified fans and critics alike, especially chafing with those who took to They Threw Us All for the clear dance/punk leanings of a number of that album's tracks (e.g. "We Live Northeast of Compton"). 2006 saw the release of Drum's Not Dead., which continued the direction they had taken with They Were Wrong but was met with a much more favorable critical reaction. 2007's self-tited LP, Liars, found the band once again shifting styles, this time towards 60's style garage rock and 70's proto-punk, all through the dark, effects-driven prism that Liars began channeling on They Were Wrong. While more straight-forward than their previous 2 LPs, the record contained the same focus on rhythm and experimentation with the deconstruction of traditional sounds. Similar to Drum's Not Dead, Liars was critically praised and found its way on to Best of 2007 lists. They released, Sisterworld, in 2010, which continued in their experimental post-punk direction. Its deluxe edition came with a completely remixed version of the album, with tracks being remixed by artists such as Thom Yorke, Kazu Makino of Blonde Redhead and Carter Tutti. In 2012, they released WIXIW, which saw the band take an almost entirely electronic direction with their music. Their seventh album, Mess, is currently slated to be released in March 2014.`,

            summary: `Max Frost is a producer and songwriter from Austin, TX signed to Atlantic Records.␊
            Frost developed his eclectic style of music playing in various projects throughout his teen years. He became a musician when he was eight, and started playing shows at 12, collaborating with a diverse array of artists like Austin icon Bob Schneider and hip-hop MC/producer Kydd. After hearing musicians like Erykah Badu and D’Angelo in his late teens, Frost began incorporating hip-hop elements into his blues-inspired stylings, interested in the idea of combining modern rhythms with classic vintage tones in his music.␊
            In September 2012 Frost decided to leave the University of Texas-Austin, where he was studying English, to pursue his solo career. He released a single, “White Lies,” which hit No. 1 on The Hype Machine’s “Most Popular Tracks on Blogs Now.” Max channeled the song’s success into the creation of his debut EP, Low High Low, which was released in October 2013 by Atlantic Records.␊
            Frost has stated that “The songs all connect to polar emotional states in life – highs and lows – giving the EP its name.” The theme continues in the production aesthetics of low-fi and high-fi, which continues as the basic concept in his music.␊
            In December 2013, "White Lies" was featured in a commercial for Beats Electronics.`,

            ␍␊
            ‘Polyester’, Clea’s enigmatic debut single, quickly racked up over two million plays on Spotify and earned acclaim from both Australian and international blogs alike. Next came the release of her second single, ‘Dire Consequences’, picked up by triple j and ushered onto a high rotation spot.␍␊
            ␍␊
            Clea's new single 'Bright Blue' sees her ethereal vocals cut through pulsating instrumentation, her lyrics delving into the complexities of our broken democracy and the myopic optimism that keeps us from rebellion and change.␍␊
            ␍␊
            Clea’s forthcoming debut EP, ‘Fairweather’, set to be released in June was co-produced by Zefereli in a mix of both challenging circumstances and inspiring surrounds; between coastal and rural Queensland abodes and inner city studios. Sublime and surprising in its simplicity, ‘Fairweather’ delves into family relationships, heartbreaking loss and existing in a world where we so desperately need and crave honest leadership.`,

            summary: `English rock combo Band of Skulls rose to prominence in the early 2010s, crafting bluesy and gritty slabs of atmospheric indie rock that echoed the work of contemporaries like the Kills, Duke Spirit, and the Black Keys. While their 2009 debut helped put them on the map, it was albums like Sweet Sour (2012) and Himalayan (2014) that earned them a widespread international following and a major-label contract for 2016's By Default.␊
            Formed by Russell Marsden (guitar and vocals), Emma Richardson (bass and vocals), and Matt Hayward (drums) while attending college in the city of Southampton, the band (which was originally called Fleeing New York) recorded a buzz-worthy demo in 2008, which resulted in its full-length debut album, Baby Darling Doll Face Honey, in 2009 and an accompanying international tour. For their second album, the band decamped to Wales' Rockfield Studios to work with producer Ian Davenport (Supergrass, Badly Drawn Boy). The results of those sessions, Sweet Sour, was released in February 2012 and contained the crunchy single "The Devil Takes Care of His Own," which had been a minor hit in Canada the previous year. The first material from their next album, produced by Nick Launay, appeared in the form of the riff-based single "Asleep at the Wheel" in January 2014. Himalayan, the accompanying full-length, was issued that spring. ␊
            After signing with BMG, Band of Skulls issued the fiery single "So Good," which preceded the release of their fourth studio long-player By Default, which dropped in May 2016. It would prove to be their last release with Hayward, who left the band in early 2017. Marsden and Richardson carried on as a duo using session drummers, then returned to the studio with producer Richard X (Goldfrapp, Pet Shop Boys) to record 2019's Love Is All You Love. ~ James Christopher Monger & James Wilkinson`,

            summary: `The story of Big Scary begins in 2006, when Melbourne duo Tom Iansek (#1 Dads) and Jo Syme, armed with just acoustic guitars and egg shakers, started playing songs together in the living room of Jo’s parents’ house. After a bit of a break, the two reconvened in 2008, this time with more instruments—electric guitars, drums, piano, mandolins and ukuleles—and a bolder, more expansive vision. What began as a few rainy day acoustic ballads in their first incarnation soon grew into an all-encompassing, genre-defying sound. Before long, the newly named Big Scary were writing anything they pleased—fuzzed-out garage rock; piano-led pop; intricate, pastoral instrumentals—each imbued with an effortless pop sensibility and lightness of touch that would quickly see the duo attract a strong following.␊
             ␊
            These gifts translated onto the stage where, from the outset, Big Scary proved themselves a remarkably fluid and compelling live act, capable of not only bringing their songs to life, but also of adapting their set to suit the moment.␊
             ␊
            In late 2008, the band headed into the studio for the first time, laying down six live tracks in a single day. Another quick-fire recording session soon after resulted in a four-track mini-EP, led by the towering single ‘This Weight’. Featuring Iansek’s huge distorted guitar and high-wire vocals backed by Syme’s thumping drums, ‘This Weight’ quickly caught the ears of the press, who hailed this ‘talented and fearless’ new duo.␊
             ␊
            Inspired by a wave of severe weather that hit the country, Big Scary went on to release the six-track ‘At The Mercy of The Elements’ ep. Ranging from rousing, piano-led ballads (‘Falling Away’), to thumping, distorted numbers (‘Hey Somebody’) and intricate, sonorous instrumentals (‘At The Mercy of the Elements’), the ep was a full-to-bursting showcase of the duo’s vital, dexterous sound. ‘Thoroughly excellent,’ raved The Australian. ‘Packed with anxiety and bravado,’ Beat said.␊
             ␊
            With a growing national profile, Big Scary embarked on a period of heavy touring, with a diverse list of supports that reflected the duo’s eclectic output: The Vasco Era, Florence and the Machine, Midlake, Little Red, Editors. Soon enough the duo began headlining their own shows, first in their hometown of Melbourne and then all over the country.␊
             ␊
            Big Scary remain endlessly fascinated by the natural world. In 2010, the duo released four seasonally themed, limited-edition eps, which were eventually collected as The Big Scary Four Seasons. A rich, thrillingly diverse set of songs, The Four Seasons showcased Iansek and Syme’s uncanny ability to translate the vagaries and glories of the elements into utterly compelling music.␊
             ␊
            ‘Four Seasons proves to be the defining turning point for Big Scary, for they are no longer the next best thing in Australian music, they are the best thing,' Beat Magazine said of the lp, while the AU Review hailed ‘the versatility and obscene… talent of the players.’␊
            A national tour followed, with the band playing to packed houses all over the country. Several months later, as the band began to ready their new album, ‘Autumn’, one of the standout tracks from the Four Seasons, was placed in a high-profile AT&amp;T ad in the US, introducing the band to American audiences for the first time.␊
             ␊
            The vision for the new record came together on a small island farm, where Iansek and Syme holed up for several weeks after a run of successful summer festival shows, writing and demoing songs. ‘We knew we had a lot of songs that we liked, but they were all so far from each other on the genre scale—super bratty garage, really poppy piano stuff, epic guitar songs, folky acoustic stuff,’ Syme says. ‘The album will still have elements of all that, but we've got some really strong tracks that we think tie it all together.’`,

Jape\'s most renowned song \'Floating\' has been covered by The Raconteurs and The Mighty Stef, to name a few. His debut album \'Cosmosphere\' was released in 2003 (Volta Records), followed by 2004\'s \'The Monkeys In The Zoo Have More Fun Than Me\' (Trust Me I\'m A Thief). Having recently signed with V2 Records (9th May 2007), a third effort \'Ritual\' came out on the 4th June 2008. The single \'Phil Lynott\' was pushed forward as a possible Christmas number one in Ireland but barely dent the charts, despite being a huge live favourite. His debut at the SXSW festival in Texas (2007) added much hype and excitement to the future prospects of Jape\'s career. In December 2008 Jape wrote a song with David Kitt for a Christmas compilation called \'An Indiecater Christmas\' which was put out by Indiecater Records. \'Ritual\' recently won the 2008 Choice Music Award.

            summary: 'David Karsten Daniels is a Dallas-based songwriter by way of Alabama, North Carolina, Oregon, and San Francisco whose music relays a personal history of diverse musical experiences - among them, a childhood of hymn singing, membership of a high school jazz band, and a formal university training in composition, theory, free improvisation, and performance art. For several years, David travelled throughout Texas and France recording quietly in small rooms, where his formal training began to give way to four-track experimentation, juxtaposing the phase pieces and improvisation of his academic life with lo-fi acoustic compositions. This itinerant approach to recording produced his first two albums (\'The Mayflower\' 2000; \'Out From Under Ligne 4\', 2001) , which employ the use of whatever (non)instruments were at hand, such as dropped coins and pencil scratches in place of drum kits, or lyrics composed by rearranging the contents of the daily newspaper.',

Other members rotate frequently, both in the studio and on stage. Eels were officially founded in 1995 when Jonathan \'Butch\' Norton and E met Tommy Walter. The name "Eels" was chosen so that the band\'s records would be close to E\'s solo records in an alphabetical ordering. In 1996 the band released their debut album Beautiful Freak. Later albums include Hombre Lobo (2009), End Times (2010), Tomorrow Morning (2010).',

            After the three founding members originally met in high school, a bassist and a drummer were found, and they all moved to a house in Silver Lake in 2008 to record their album. Their debut album as Local Natives, "Gorilla Manor", was released in the UK on November 2nd, 2009, and saw a US release date of February 16th, 2010. The band's sound has been described as "afropop-influenced guitars with hyperactive drumming and hooky three-part harmonies". They started to attract the attention of the music press after playing nine shows at the 2009 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. Initial reviews of Local Natives have drawn favourable comparisons to Arcade Fire, Fleet Foxes and Vampire Weekend.`,

            summary: `The Antlers are an indie rock band currently based in Brooklyn, New York, fronted by Peter Silberman. Initially, The Antlers was a solo project created by vocalist and guitarist Silberman immediately after he had moved to Brooklyn, New York, in 2007. Silberman wrote the first two albums, "Uprooted" and "In the Attic of the Universe" by himself and under his own name. Afterwards, he recruited Lerner and Cicci, becoming a collaborative group. The band recorded two EPs: "Cold War" and "New York Hospitals". Silberman's collection of songs (which was mentioned as an "elegy for his planned disappearance") would later become a full-length album titled "Hospice" and would feature an epic storyline, telling the story of an abusive relationship through an allegory of a hospice worker losing a patient—for whom he developed feelings for—to bone cancer. Silberman has stated that the album is mostly auto-biographical. The album was independently released by the band in March of 2009, selling an apparently overwhelming number of copies, later selling all of their stock and had to produce more. The band later commented that they had "bit off more than they could chew". The album received critical praise for both its narrative and musicianship and has since been listed on several "Album of the Year" lists. The band later signed with New York-based French Kiss Records. The label released a remastered "Hospice" on August 18, 2009. In 2011, they released "Burst Apart," their follow-up to "Hospice." The album was received with critical acclaim equal to its predecessor, and the band subsequently launched a world tour in support of the record.␊
            They released the (together) EP shortly after Burst Apart which contained 8 remixes and covers with several collaberating artists.␊
            In 2012 the Undersea EP was released containing 4 new songs. ␊
            On March 31th 2014 the band announced the 5th studio album called "Familiars". It was released on June 17th 2014 receiving critical acclaim worldwide.`,

            summary: 'Chicago punk rockers, circus act, and marching band Mucca Pazza formed on a principle that many musicians shun out of hand: band geeks are awesome. In fact, much of Mucca Pazza\'s appeal comes from their wholehearted acceptance -- even celebration -- of the band nerd identity. The 30-piece group includes standard marching band fare like saxophones, sousaphone, trumpets, trombones, and drums in addition to less common elements like accordion, guitar, violin, and designated cheerleaders. Taking to the stage in intentionally mismatched thrift-store band uniforms, Mucca Pazza perform repertoire including rearranged rock tunes, traditional Czech folk songs, original compositions, and other strange bedfellows too numerous to name. Band director Mark Messing first invited instrumentalist friends to meet up in Chicago\'s industrial district to play, hoping to create a "marching band culture nostalgia group." More and more musicians continued to arrive for auditions, until the band had swollen to its current epic size. Building up interest and curiosity through word of mouth alone, Mucca Pazza began performing in local bars and clubs. Though it took some time, concert attendees eventually started to outnumber musicians. Performance venues themselves began to compete with the band for oddness, and have included public parks, the stage of Late Night with Conan O\'Brien, and canoes floating down the Chicago River. In 2007 Mucca Pazza filled a bus and took to the road for their first-ever tour, following the recording of their debut EP, the 30-minute A Little Marching Band. Plans were in the works for more touring and a full-length album to be released in 2008.',

          summary: '101 Strings was an umbrella term for a highly successful easy listening symphonic music organization, with a discography exceeding a hundred albums and a creative lifetime of roughly thirty years. Their LPs were individualized by the slogan "The Sound of Magnificence", a puffy cloud logo and sepia-toned photo of the orchestra.

The orchestra\'s famous official photograph was taken in the Musikhalle Hamburg. Read more on Last.fm.

          summary: `Deriving their name from the metric total of semen ejaculated by the average male, the tongue-in-cheek British art-pop band 10cc comprised an all-star roster of Manchester-based musicians: vocalist/guitarist Graham Gouldman was a former member of the Mockingbirds and the author of hits for the Yardbirds, the Hollies, Herman's Hermits and Jeff Beck; singer/guitarist Eric Stewart was an alum of Wayne Fontana & the Mindbenders; and vocalists/multi-instrumentalists Kevin Godley and Lol Creme were both highly regarded studio players. Formed in 1970, 10cc began as a session unit dubbed Hotlegs; after establishing residence at Stewart's Strawberry Studios, Hotlegs scored a surprise U.K. smash with the single "Neanderthal Man," subsequently issuing an LP, Thinks: School Times and touring with the Moody Blues.␍␊
          After signing to Jonathan King's U.K. label and rechristening themselves 10cc (a name suggested by King himself), the group backed Neil Sedaka before recording 1972's "Donna," a sly satire of late-'50s doo wop. The single reached the number two position on the British charts, establishing not only a long-running string of major hits, but also the quartet's fondness for ironic and affectionate reclamations of musty pop styles. The follow-up, "Rubber Bullets," topped the charts in 1973, and both the subsequent single "The Dean and I" (a nostalgic look at academia recalling Jerry Lee Lewis' "High School Confidential") and an eponymously titled debut LP further solidified 10cc as a major force in British pop. ␍␊
          While 1974's Sheet Music and singles, including the Brian Wilson-esque "Wall Street Shuffle," "Silly Love" and "Life Is a Minestrone" continued 10cc's dominance of the U.K. charts, they found the American market virtually impenetrable prior to the release of 1975's "I'm Not in Love," which topped the charts at home and climbed as high as number two in the States. After 1975's Original Soundtrack and the next year's How Dare You!, Godley and Creme exited to focus on video production as well as developing the Gizmo, a guitar modification device the duo invented. In the wake of their departure, Gouldman and Stewart continued on alone, enlisting the aid of session men to record 1977's Deceptive Bends, highlighted by the perennial "The Things We Do for Love."␍␊
          After recruiting guitarist Rick Fenn, keyboardist Tony O'Malley and drummer Stuart Tosh as full-time members, 10cc returned in 1978 with Bloody Tourists, which yielded the number one reggae nod "Dreadlock Holiday." Following a series of unsuccessful efforts, including 1980s Look Hear?, 1981's 10 Out of 10 and 1983's Window in the Jungle, the group disbanded; while Stewart produced Sad Cafe and worked with Paul McCartney, Gouldman supervised recordings for the Ramones and Gilbert O'Sullivan before joining Andrew Gold in the duo Wax. In 1992, the original lineup of 10cc reunited for the LP Meanwhile, while only Gouldman and Stewart remained for 1993's Mirror Mirror. ~ Jason Ankeny`,

          summary: `Hailing from Manchester, U.K., the 1975 managed to combine the dark and youthful themes of sex, love, and fear with ethereal alt-rock music. The four-piece met at school in 2002, although lead singer and guitarist Matt Healy was born in London and drummer George Daniel was born across the North Sea in Brussels. The rest of the lineup was comprised of Adam Hann on guitar and bassist Ross MacDonald. The first incarnation of the band began by covering punk songs at gigs arranged for underage youths -- which would quickly descend into chaos. Influenced by a range of styles, from Michael Jackson, Motown, and the Rolling Stones to the soundscapes of Brian Eno, Boards of Canada, and Sigur Rós, they soon began to apply their pop-influenced hooks and guitar melodies to the lush ambient backdrops they created. ␍␊
          In 2012, they released their first EP, Facedown, on U.K. indie label Dirty Hit, and soon after supported Little Comets on their nationwide tour. The lead track from the debut EP, "The City," was played on Huw Stephens' BBC Radio 1 show, and the quartet's energetic live performances endeared them to crowds, while their music began to sweep across music blogs. Toward the end of 2012 they released a second EP, entitled Sex, and the title track was played by influential BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe. The following year, a third EP appeared, titled Music for Cars, and spawned U.K. Top 20 single "Chocolate." Their popularity continued to rise and they went on to play shows across the U.K. and were also invited to play at industry showcase SXSW in conjunction with a U.S. tour. Their self-titled debut -- recorded with producer Mike Crossey (Arctic Monkeys, Foals) -- was released in 2013. ~ Scott Kerr`,

          summary: `Hailing from the small town of Escatawpa, Mississippi, 3 Doors Down hit their peak in the early 2000s with a string of post-grunge singles, most notably "Kryptonite," "When I'm Gone," and the ballad "Here Without You." "Kryptonite," with its minor-key shuffle and references to Superman, was the catalyst for the band's career, generating an unprecedented buzz at a local radio station -- Biloxi's WCPR -- during the band's independent days. Such support helped make 3 Doors Down a regional favorite, enabling them to draw relatively large crowds to their local live shows and, consequently, extending their popularity beyond the Deep South to internationally famous clubs like New York's CBGB's.␍␊
          The founding members of 3 Doors Down -- vocalist/drummer Brad Arnold, guitarist Matt Roberts, and bassist Todd Harrell -- were raised in Escatawpa, a cozy town of 8,000 people. Although brought up in religious households, the musicians also felt the call of rock & roll at an early age, eventually forming a rock trio in 1994 to play a friend's backyard party. As the years progressed, so did the band's sound, and the group soon added guitarist Chris Henderson and retained a studio drummer so that Arnold could come forward and sing live. After touring the Gulf Coast's venues, the band made its way to New York, where a showcase at CBGB's brought 3 Doors Down to the attention of Republic Records. A subsidiary of Universal, Republic Records signed the musicians and issued their major-label debut, The Better Life, in early 2000. ␍␊
          The Better Life became one of the biggest-selling albums of 2000, going platinum four times during its first year of release and spawning several singles. The band furthered its success with 2002's Away from the Sun, which debuted at number eight on the Billboard Top 200 and, like its predecessor, climbed to multi-platinum status. 3 Doors Down toured steadily throughout 2003 and 2004 in support of Away from the Sun, and issued the live EP Another 700 Miles in November 2003 as a holdover between studio efforts. The group returned with a heavier album, Seventeen Days, in early 2005. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and went platinum in its first week of release. A self-titled album, which followed in May 2008, repeated its predecessor's success when it too debuted at the top of the Billboard 200. ␍␊
          3 Doors Down toured throughout 2009, released a digital-only acoustic holiday album at the end of the year, and began to work on their next album in 2010. With Howard Benson serving as producer, the guys shuttled themselves between L.A. and Tokyo, recording the album in both cities and eventually emerging with 2011's Time of My Life. ~ Stacia Proefrock`,

          summary: 'Pal Waaktaar and Magne Furuholmen, formerly of Bridges formed a-ha in the early \'80s. Morten Harket joined the duo, and they left for the now "legendary London flat" (so called because of its state of disrepair) to make it. By late 1983 they had achieved part of that goal by signing to WEA. "Take on Me" took three times to become a hit in the U.K., eventually hitting number two in November 1985. Going one better in the U.S. mainly due to the wide exposure of its stunning video on MTV, which fused animation with real-life action, their only further hit there was "The Sun Always Shines on T.V." which became a U.K. number one in early 1986 helping take the album Hunting High and Low to the Top Ten. Mostly an album of synth pop, the press were quick to dismiss them as a teeny bop sensation; however, there was more to a-ha than met the ear in Waaktaar\'s writing, and a more mature effort, Scoundrel Days, was released in October, 1986. More focused, it had a stronger band feel thanks to its live drumming, displayed to great lengths on "The Swing of Things and lead single "I\'ve Been Losing You" -- a shock to critics at the time. Further striking imagery accompanied "Cry Wolf." After a world tour, a-ha supplied the soundtrack to the James Bond flick The Living Daylights. A remix appeared on their third album, Stay on These Roads, in 1988. Considered lackluster, Stay on These Roads did feature some interesting lyrics in "Blood That Moves the Body," regarding the over-intense affection the Japanese had for popular icons in their kamikaze-like suicides. On a lighter note, one of the famous quotes of this period came from Waaktaar: commenting on Def Leppard\'s success with Hysteria, he scoffed that a-ha were more rock & roll! In 1990, a-ha were commended by the Everly Brothers for their rendition of "Crying in the Rain" from their fourth album, East of the Sun, West of the Moon, which was largely ignored in the U.K. due to a shift in interests towards dance and the Manchester scene. 1993 heralded some much needed new blood in the U2 terrain of "Dark Is the Night" from the Memorial Beach album. Following the unfortunate lack of success following Memorial Beach, Furuholmen retreated into the art world while Waaktaar released the album Mary Is Coming with his new band Savoy. Seven years after the release of Memorial Beach, a-ha issued Minor Earth Major Sky in summer 2000. 2002\'s Lifelines sold well in Europe and was followed by a lengthy tour, documented on the live album How Can I Sleep with Your Voice in My Head, which was released in 2003. A year later the band celebrated their 20th anniversary by releasing Singles 1984-2004, a collection that would put them back on the U.K. Top 20 Albums chart. In July of 2005 the band performed in Berlin as part of the massive worldwide event Live8. In November they released the new album Analogue. It was supported by a world-wide tour that included gigs in Russia and a festival in Chile. The group\'s ninth studio album, Foot of the Mountain, was released in 2009. ~ Kelvin Hayes',

Since then, the Kansas City group’s songs have been featured on MTV (The Inbetweeners), Daytrotter, and a bunch of blogs (You Ain’t No Picasso, We Listen For You, Decoder Magazine). They’ve also performed alongside like-minded acts Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin, Starfucker, and Haim.',

Their LPs were individualized by the slogan "The Sound of Magnificence", a puffy cloud logo and sepia-toned photo of the orchestra. The 101 Strings orchestra was actually composed of 124 string instruments (all male except for the harpist) and was conducted by Wilhelm Stephan.

            summary: `Deriving their name from the metric total of semen ejaculated by the average male, the tongue-in-cheek British art-pop band 10cc comprised an all-star roster of Manchester-based musicians: vocalist/guitarist Graham Gouldman was a former member of the Mockingbirds and the author of hits for the Yardbirds, the Hollies, Herman's Hermits and Jeff Beck; singer/guitarist Eric Stewart was an alum of Wayne Fontana & the Mindbenders; and vocalists/multi-instrumentalists Kevin Godley and Lol Creme were both highly regarded studio players. Formed in 1970, 10cc began as a session unit dubbed Hotlegs; after establishing residence at Stewart's Strawberry Studios, Hotlegs scored a surprise U.K. smash with the single "Neanderthal Man," subsequently issuing an LP, Thinks: School Times and touring with the Moody Blues.␍␊
            After signing to Jonathan King's U.K. label and rechristening themselves 10cc (a name suggested by King himself), the group backed Neil Sedaka before recording 1972's "Donna," a sly satire of late-'50s doo wop. The single reached the number two position on the British charts, establishing not only a long-running string of major hits, but also the quartet's fondness for ironic and affectionate reclamations of musty pop styles. The follow-up, "Rubber Bullets," topped the charts in 1973, and both the subsequent single "The Dean and I" (a nostalgic look at academia recalling Jerry Lee Lewis' "High School Confidential") and an eponymously titled debut LP further solidified 10cc as a major force in British pop. ␍␊
            While 1974's Sheet Music and singles, including the Brian Wilson-esque "Wall Street Shuffle," "Silly Love" and "Life Is a Minestrone" continued 10cc's dominance of the U.K. charts, they found the American market virtually impenetrable prior to the release of 1975's "I'm Not in Love," which topped the charts at home and climbed as high as number two in the States. After 1975's Original Soundtrack and the next year's How Dare You!, Godley and Creme exited to focus on video production as well as developing the Gizmo, a guitar modification device the duo invented. In the wake of their departure, Gouldman and Stewart continued on alone, enlisting the aid of session men to record 1977's Deceptive Bends, highlighted by the perennial "The Things We Do for Love."␍␊
            After recruiting guitarist Rick Fenn, keyboardist Tony O'Malley and drummer Stuart Tosh as full-time members, 10cc returned in 1978 with Bloody Tourists, which yielded the number one reggae nod "Dreadlock Holiday." Following a series of unsuccessful efforts, including 1980s Look Hear?, 1981's 10 Out of 10 and 1983's Window in the Jungle, the group disbanded; while Stewart produced Sad Cafe and worked with Paul McCartney, Gouldman supervised recordings for the Ramones and Gilbert O'Sullivan before joining Andrew Gold in the duo Wax. In 1992, the original lineup of 10cc reunited for the LP Meanwhile, while only Gouldman and Stewart remained for 1993's Mirror Mirror. ~ Jason Ankeny`,

            summary: `Hailing from Manchester, U.K., the 1975 managed to combine the dark and youthful themes of sex, love, and fear with ethereal alt-rock music. The four-piece met at school in 2002, although lead singer and guitarist Matt Healy was born in London and drummer George Daniel was born across the North Sea in Brussels. The rest of the lineup was comprised of Adam Hann on guitar and bassist Ross MacDonald. The first incarnation of the band began by covering punk songs at gigs arranged for underage youths -- which would quickly descend into chaos. Influenced by a range of styles, from Michael Jackson, Motown, and the Rolling Stones to the soundscapes of Brian Eno, Boards of Canada, and Sigur Rós, they soon began to apply their pop-influenced hooks and guitar melodies to the lush ambient backdrops they created. ␍␊
            In 2012, they released their first EP, Facedown, on U.K. indie label Dirty Hit, and soon after supported Little Comets on their nationwide tour. The lead track from the debut EP, "The City," was played on Huw Stephens' BBC Radio 1 show, and the quartet's energetic live performances endeared them to crowds, while their music began to sweep across music blogs. Toward the end of 2012 they released a second EP, entitled Sex, and the title track was played by influential BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe. The following year, a third EP appeared, titled Music for Cars, and spawned U.K. Top 20 single "Chocolate." Their popularity continued to rise and they went on to play shows across the U.K. and were also invited to play at industry showcase SXSW in conjunction with a U.S. tour. Their self-titled debut -- recorded with producer Mike Crossey (Arctic Monkeys, Foals) -- was released in 2013. ~ Scott Kerr`,

            summary: `Hailing from the small town of Escatawpa, Mississippi, 3 Doors Down hit their peak in the early 2000s with a string of post-grunge singles, most notably "Kryptonite," "When I'm Gone," and the ballad "Here Without You." "Kryptonite," with its minor-key shuffle and references to Superman, was the catalyst for the band's career, generating an unprecedented buzz at a local radio station -- Biloxi's WCPR -- during the band's independent days. Such support helped make 3 Doors Down a regional favorite, enabling them to draw relatively large crowds to their local live shows and, consequently, extending their popularity beyond the Deep South to internationally famous clubs like New York's CBGB's.␍␊
            The founding members of 3 Doors Down -- vocalist/drummer Brad Arnold, guitarist Matt Roberts, and bassist Todd Harrell -- were raised in Escatawpa, a cozy town of 8,000 people. Although brought up in religious households, the musicians also felt the call of rock & roll at an early age, eventually forming a rock trio in 1994 to play a friend's backyard party. As the years progressed, so did the band's sound, and the group soon added guitarist Chris Henderson and retained a studio drummer so that Arnold could come forward and sing live. After touring the Gulf Coast's venues, the band made its way to New York, where a showcase at CBGB's brought 3 Doors Down to the attention of Republic Records. A subsidiary of Universal, Republic Records signed the musicians and issued their major-label debut, The Better Life, in early 2000. ␍␊
            The Better Life became one of the biggest-selling albums of 2000, going platinum four times during its first year of release and spawning several singles. The band furthered its success with 2002's Away from the Sun, which debuted at number eight on the Billboard Top 200 and, like its predecessor, climbed to multi-platinum status. 3 Doors Down toured steadily throughout 2003 and 2004 in support of Away from the Sun, and issued the live EP Another 700 Miles in November 2003 as a holdover between studio efforts. The group returned with a heavier album, Seventeen Days, in early 2005. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and went platinum in its first week of release. A self-titled album, which followed in May 2008, repeated its predecessor's success when it too debuted at the top of the Billboard 200. ␍␊
            3 Doors Down toured throughout 2009, released a digital-only acoustic holiday album at the end of the year, and began to work on their next album in 2010. With Howard Benson serving as producer, the guys shuttled themselves between L.A. and Tokyo, recording the album in both cities and eventually emerging with 2011's Time of My Life. ~ Stacia Proefrock`,

            summary: 'The 5th Dimension is an American popular music vocal group, whose repertoire also includes R&amp;B, Soul, and Jazz, best-known during the late 1960s and 1970s for popularizing hits of songwriters like Jimmy Webb, Laura Nyro, Burt Bacharach, Ashford & Simpson, and others, and helping to popularize "flower power" music with both white and black middle-class Americans.',

            summary: 'Pal Waaktaar and Magne Furuholmen, formerly of Bridges formed a-ha in the early \'80s. Morten Harket joined the duo, and they left for the now "legendary London flat" (so called because of its state of disrepair) to make it. By late 1983 they had achieved part of that goal by signing to WEA. "Take on Me" took three times to become a hit in the U.K., eventually hitting number two in November 1985. Going one better in the U.S. mainly due to the wide exposure of its stunning video on MTV, which fused animation with real-life action, their only further hit there was "The Sun Always Shines on T.V." which became a U.K. number one in early 1986 helping take the album Hunting High and Low to the Top Ten. Mostly an album of synth pop, the press were quick to dismiss them as a teeny bop sensation; however, there was more to a-ha than met the ear in Waaktaar\'s writing, and a more mature effort, Scoundrel Days, was released in October, 1986. More focused, it had a stronger band feel thanks to its live drumming, displayed to great lengths on "The Swing of Things and lead single "I\'ve Been Losing You" -- a shock to critics at the time. Further striking imagery accompanied "Cry Wolf." After a world tour, a-ha supplied the soundtrack to the James Bond flick The Living Daylights. A remix appeared on their third album, Stay on These Roads, in 1988. Considered lackluster, Stay on These Roads did feature some interesting lyrics in "Blood That Moves the Body," regarding the over-intense affection the Japanese had for popular icons in their kamikaze-like suicides. On a lighter note, one of the famous quotes of this period came from Waaktaar: commenting on Def Leppard\'s success with Hysteria, he scoffed that a-ha were more rock & roll! In 1990, a-ha were commended by the Everly Brothers for their rendition of "Crying in the Rain" from their fourth album, East of the Sun, West of the Moon, which was largely ignored in the U.K. due to a shift in interests towards dance and the Manchester scene. 1993 heralded some much needed new blood in the U2 terrain of "Dark Is the Night" from the Memorial Beach album. Following the unfortunate lack of success following Memorial Beach, Furuholmen retreated into the art world while Waaktaar released the album Mary Is Coming with his new band Savoy. Seven years after the release of Memorial Beach, a-ha issued Minor Earth Major Sky in summer 2000. 2002\'s Lifelines sold well in Europe and was followed by a lengthy tour, documented on the live album How Can I Sleep with Your Voice in My Head, which was released in 2003. A year later the band celebrated their 20th anniversary by releasing Singles 1984-2004, a collection that would put them back on the U.K. Top 20 Albums chart. In July of 2005 the band performed in Berlin as part of the massive worldwide event Live8. In November they released the new album Analogue. It was supported by a world-wide tour that included gigs in Russia and a festival in Chile. The group\'s ninth studio album, Foot of the Mountain, was released in 2009. ~ Kelvin Hayes',
