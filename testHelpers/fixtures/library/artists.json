With deceptively pretty arrangements that echo filigreed late-sixties folk-pop and an easygoing rapport between singers, this duets collaboration may seem like the perfect accompaniment to a sunny summer’s day, Southern-California style. But it works even better as a comforting soundtrack at the end of a dark, lonely night in the big city. The atmosphere the pair conjures up with strummed guitars and discreet layers of synths indeed suggests romantic possibility, but the lyrics are more sweetly melancholic, gently but candidly addressing betrayal, incipient heartbreak, and conjugal discord. It’s an approach that makes for compelling repeated listening, as the intimate dramas reveal themselves, and it’s one that surprised even Green and Shapiro as their debut album together began to take shape.",

It's said that Mark was humming some indistinct tune while Brandon, seated rowed the opposite of his tall passenger-companion, feverishly scribed words into a moleskin. A few measures into his tune, respectively a few stanzas into his quatrain, Mark's and Brandon's efforts reached a pinnacle of symbiosis. Mark's vocal modulations and Brandon's muttered assonance's suddenly fell into a perfect rhythm. Slowly they turned to look at one another, their eyes wide. There was struck the ongoing friendship between these two. Musically, it never stopped. Together they agreed to leave their wonderland of lumber-jacking to pursue a musical career.\nLeaving their bucolic ice-land, they trekked to Provo, Utah with only their feet to carry them. The result of their 11 month journey to Utah Valley was a renewed sense of wonder and enough know-how to get them a weekly slot at the local open mic.\nIt didn't take long for word of their matching hair and musical prowess to spread and soon The Moth & The Flame had officially formed.",

        "summary": "Bibio is Stephen James Wilkinson from Wolverhampton, England. Wilkinson studied 'Sonic Arts' between 1999 - 2002 at Middlesex University in North London, it was during this time in London he came up with the name Bibio. The name was taken from a small black and red fishing fly which was favoured by his father on their fishing trips to Wales during Stephen's childhood, the name therefore has nostalgic meaning which is often a theme in his music. His recording career as Bibio started with Mush records in 2004. His Mush releases consist of 3 albums and 1 EP. In 2009 he signed to Warp records and so far has released a further 2 albums, an EP containing remix contributions from other artists and several singles. Bibio's music combines electronic and acoustic/traditional instruments, his main instrument being guitar. Bibio's signature 'grainy' sound is partly due to the use of analogue tape and vintage recording equipment, which is more exaggerated in his earlier Mush releases. Wilkinson himself labeled his debut on Mush as \"Saturated Folk\". Bibio's recent output, particularly on Warp, has been more diverse, with an increasing use of his own vocals, drums/beats and electronics. His Mush debut 'Fi' was described by Marcus Eoin of Boards of Canada as: \"The antidote to the modern laptopia of pristine electronic music...\". In 2009, Bibio contributed a cover version of Boards of Canada's 'Kaini Industries' to the Warp 20th Anniversary 'Recreated' album. Read more on Last.fm.

The friends shared a passion for bands of the 60's such as The Beach Boys, The Beatles, and The Zombies, as well as an affinity for newer, noisier bands such as Sonic Youth and Minutemen. They reflected these influences in the tapes they recorded and shared with each other, forming the seeds of what would become the Elephant Six Collective. While Robert Schneider became the \"popular\" face of the collective with the eventual success of The Apples in Stereo, Mangum would ultimately release some of the collective's most interesting and enduringly popular music.",

Born in Suffolk, Eno attended art school in Ipswich in the late 1960s, where he studied under Roy Ascott and took inspiration from minimalist painting, cybernetics, and experimental music techniques. Eno has frequently been described as one of popular music's most important and influential figures. A self-described 'non-musician', Eno has helped to pioneer a variety of novel studio production techniques and approaches, playing an important role in the development of ambient, electronic, worldbeat, chance, and generative music styles. He continues to release music, produce, and write, and maintains a regular column in Prospect Magazine.",

        "title": "Oberhofer",
        "summary": "Oberhofer started in 2008 as the recording project of Brad Oberhofer. After moving from his native Tacoma, Washington to New York City, Oberhofer attended New York University to study music composition.[1] In the style of Jon Bon Jovi, the young singer adopted his own name as the title of the project. Although the band has since gone through various lineup formations, the name has remained the same because Oberhofer writes and records all the music himself.[2]\nIn 2010, Oberhofer self-released his first single o0Oo0O0o and was soon asked to go on tour with bands like Sleigh Bells, Neon Indian, and The Morning Benders.[1] After hitting the road for a year, Oberhofer released Away Frm U and I Could Go in 2011. The two singles brought the attention of independent label White Iris Records who released the band's next single Gotta Go/Mahwun in the summer of 2011. Soon after, Oberhofer signed with Glassnote Records to release their debut album.[3] Stereogum ranked the band as the No. 39 most anticipated album of 2012.[4]\nBrad began work on Time Capsules II in the studio with Grammy Award winning producer Steve Lillywhite in November 2011, recording vocals and most instrumental tracks himself, and pulling in bandmates and other instrumentalists to complete certain tracks. Glassnote released Time Capsules II on in the United States on March 27, 2012.[5] In anticipation for the release, the band performed \"Away Frm U\" on the Late Show with David Letterman.[6]\nOberhofer performed widely in clubs and on the festival circuit in support of Time Capsules II. Recent notable performances include in the Mojave Tent at the 2012 edition of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.[7] and the Budweiser stage at Lollapalooza in Chicago on August 5, 2012,.[8] They are scheduled to perform at the Austin City Limits Music Festival on October 13.[9]\nThey are currently on tour with Matt & Kim from 9/16-11/17.

        "summary": "English singer/songwriter Andrew \"Roo\" Panes' introspective lyrics, soulful voice, and deft fingerpicking have drawn comparisons to artists like Nick Drake, George Ezra, and Laura Marling. He issued his first EP, Once, in 2012 and stayed loyal to a hushed, acoustic palette across subsequent releases, including his full-length debut, 2014's Little Giant.  Born into an artistic family in Wimborne, Dorset, Panes earned his Hundred Acre Wood-inspired nickname after falling into a river as a child, much like Winnie the Pooh did during a heated game of Poohsticks. Panes released his first in a series of well-received independent EPs, Once, in 2012, the same year he gained exposure via a campaign for luxury British fashion house Burberry. CRC Music released the EPs Weight of Your World and Land of the Living in 2012 and 2013, respectively, before issuing his proper full-length debut, Little Giant, in 2014. Maintaining an intimate presence and instrumentation limited to mostly 12-string guitar, occasional piano, and strings, his sophomore studio LP, Paperweights, followed in early 2016. His next album, Quiet Man, was written and recorded in the English countryside. It saw release in 2018, also by CRC. ~ James Christopher Monger & Marcy Donelson",

        "title": "Wampire",
        "summary": "In 2007, longtime best friends Rocky Tinder and Eric Phipps moved to Portland, Oregon and decided to start a band. With all the buoyancy and idealism of youth (being fresh out of high school at the time), and stimulated by the massive amount of creative output surrounding them in their new city, they sketched out a vision for a massive friend band  - the possibility of getting every single one of their buds on stage and creating a monumental live show. Yet both boys have discerning taste, having backgrounds in music theory from a tender age, and questioned the logistics of a chaotic set-up. Moreover, they were enamored of the freedom that local dance music outfits had with their compact set-ups, allowing these acts to show up and throw down anywhere. Accordingly, they tweaked their vision and decided to just do it themselves. Armed with two guitars and an iPod filled with their meticulously prerecorded beats, bass lines, and bells, they became Wampire – two boys on a mission to have as much fun being a dance-rock duo as 20 people combined. Now, 3 years later, with the new addition of drummer Cyrus Lampton for extra beats and extra smiles, it is very safe to say that Wampire have succeeded: this band is epically, epically fun. Whether rocking out in the dark of a nightclub, with Flashdance projected behind them from out of Tinder's gold-painted VCR, or stripping down to their skivvies during an afternoon parking lot performance, Wampire is a sight to behold. They're certainly not taking themselves too seriously, but one can say a lot more than that about their live show. Their easy chemistry and inexhaustible joviality is totally infectious – you're powerless to resist the dance floor when they take the stage. They've also managed, in a rare feat these days, to wed onstage antics with bonafide musicianship, earning them love from musicians, critics, and fans all over Portland. From their delightful re-invention of Kraftwerk's “Das model,” sung impeccably in German by Phipps over a sleek synth-pop landscape, to original jewels like “Hyphy shred” which boasts soaring guitars and blissed-out glitchiness, their work would be right at home amongst the current Chillwave phenomenon made popular by Neon Indian, Washed Out, Small Black, etc. Yet don't be confused into thinking that their bliss is purely aesthetic, for there is no too-cool posturing when it comes to Wamp-Wamp, as Wampire is often affectionately called around town. Their aesthetic arose organically, out of the stoner/skater/slacker subculture to which they belong, having built a fanbase from the basement up via Portland's vibrant house show scene. Among these roots is a stint living, working, and curating all-ages shows at the legendary now-defunct downtown Portland performance space The Hush. Now, they're considered one of the staples of Portland's dance/electronic scene, sharing bills with local greats like Starfucker, Reporter, and Glass Candy.  Read more on Last.fm.

Australian-born Angus Andrew is the founding and only constant member with Aaron Hemphill (percussion, guitar, synth) leaving the project in 2017 and Julian Gross (drums) no longer is able to perform due to personal reasons. The band have released 8 studio albums since forming and remain to be one of the few bands remain to be consistently active from the Post-Punk Revival scene in New York of 2000s.\n \nAlthough initially lumped into the New York dance-punk scene of the early 21st century, they have come to be categorized by their dramatic stylistic shifts between albums, while retaining a consistent interest in rhythm and sound texture. Liars are one of the many contemporary bands to draw from the late 1970's British post-punk movement. Their first album, 2002's They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument on Top, bore some resemblance to the work of Delta 5 and Gang of Four, accenting their angular, acerbic punk with modern synths and drum machines. Liar's second album, 2004's They Were Wrong, So We Drowned, eschewed their debut's trendy post-punk aesthetic in favor of dissonant atmospherics and electronic soundscapes more akin to the sound of This Heat. That album stratified fans and critics alike, especially chafing with those who took to They Threw Us All for the clear dance/punk leanings of a number of that album's tracks (e.g. \"We Live Northeast of Compton\"). 2006 saw the release of Drum's Not Dead., which continued the direction they had taken with They Were Wrong but was met with a much more favorable critical reaction. 2007's self-tited LP, Liars, found the band once again shifting styles, this time towards 60's style garage rock and 70's proto-punk, all through the dark, effects-driven prism that Liars began channeling on They Were Wrong. While more straight-forward than their previous 2 LPs, the record contained the same focus on rhythm and experimentation with the deconstruction of traditional sounds. Similar to Drum's Not Dead, Liars was critically praised and found its way on to Best of 2007 lists. They released, Sisterworld, in 2010, which continued in their experimental post-punk direction. Its deluxe edition came with a completely remixed version of the album, with tracks being remixed by artists such as Thom Yorke, Kazu Makino of Blonde Redhead and Carter Tutti. In 2012, they released WIXIW, which saw the band take an almost entirely electronic direction with their music. Their seventh album, Mess, is currently slated to be released in March 2014.",

He became a musician when he was eight, and started playing shows at 12, collaborating with a diverse array of artists like Austin icon Bob Schneider and hip-hop MC/producer Kydd. After hearing musicians like Erykah Badu and D’Angelo in his late teens, Frost began incorporating hip-hop elements into his blues-inspired stylings, interested in the idea of combining modern rhythms with classic vintage tones in his music.\nIn September 2012 Frost decided to leave the University of Texas-Austin, where he was studying English, to pursue his solo career. He released a single, “White Lies,” which hit No. 1 on The Hype Machine’s “Most Popular Tracks on Blogs Now.” Max channeled the song’s success into the creation of his debut EP, Low High Low, which was released in October 2013 by Atlantic Records.\nFrost has stated that “The songs all connect to polar emotional states in life – highs and lows – giving the EP its name.” The theme continues in the production aesthetics of low-fi and high-fi, which continues as the basic concept in his music.\nIn December 2013, \"White Lies\" was featured in a commercial for Beats Electronics.",

        "summary": "English rock combo Band of Skulls rose to prominence in the early 2010s, crafting bluesy and gritty slabs of atmospheric indie rock that echoed the work of contemporaries like the Kills, Duke Spirit, and the Black Keys. While their 2009 debut helped put them on the map, it was albums like Sweet Sour (2012) and Himalayan (2014) that earned them a widespread international following and a major-label contract for 2016's By Default.\nFormed by Russell Marsden (guitar and vocals), Emma Richardson (bass and vocals), and Matt Hayward (drums) while attending college in the city of Southampton, the band (which was originally called Fleeing New York) recorded a buzz-worthy demo in 2008, which resulted in its full-length debut album, Baby Darling Doll Face Honey, in 2009 and an accompanying international tour. For their second album, the band decamped to Wales' Rockfield Studios to work with producer Ian Davenport (Supergrass, Badly Drawn Boy). The results of those sessions, Sweet Sour, was released in February 2012 and contained the crunchy single \"The Devil Takes Care of His Own,\" which had been a minor hit in Canada the previous year. The first material from their next album, produced by Nick Launay, appeared in the form of the riff-based single \"Asleep at the Wheel\" in January 2014. Himalayan, the accompanying full-length, was issued that spring. \nAfter signing with BMG, Band of Skulls issued the fiery single \"So Good,\" which preceded the release of their fourth studio long-player By Default, which dropped in May 2016. It would prove to be their last release with Hayward, who left the band in early 2017. Marsden and Richardson carried on as a duo using session drummers, then returned to the studio with producer Richard X (Goldfrapp, Pet Shop Boys) to record 2019's Love Is All You Love. ~ James Christopher Monger & James Wilkinson",

        "title": "Big Scary",
        "summary": "The story of Big Scary begins in 2006, when Melbourne duo Tom Iansek (#1 Dads) and Jo Syme, armed with just acoustic guitars and egg shakers, started playing songs together in the living room of Jo’s parents’ house. After a bit of a break, the two reconvened in 2008, this time with more instruments—electric guitars, drums, piano, mandolins and ukuleles—and a bolder, more expansive vision. What began as a few rainy day acoustic ballads in their first incarnation soon grew into an all-encompassing, genre-defying sound. Before long, the newly named Big Scary were writing anything they pleased—fuzzed-out garage rock; piano-led pop; intricate, pastoral instrumentals—each imbued with an effortless pop sensibility and lightness of touch that would quickly see the duo attract a strong following.\n \nThese gifts translated onto the stage where, from the outset, Big Scary proved themselves a remarkably fluid and compelling live act, capable of not only bringing their songs to life, but also of adapting their set to suit the moment.\n \nIn late 2008, the band headed into the studio for the first time, laying down six live tracks in a single day. Another quick-fire recording session soon after resulted in a four-track mini-EP, led by the towering single ‘This Weight’. Featuring Iansek’s huge distorted guitar and high-wire vocals backed by Syme’s thumping drums, ‘This Weight’ quickly caught the ears of the press, who hailed this ‘talented and fearless’ new duo.\n \nInspired by a wave of severe weather that hit the country, Big Scary went on to release the six-track ‘At The Mercy of The Elements’ ep. Ranging from rousing, piano-led ballads (‘Falling Away’), to thumping, distorted numbers (‘Hey Somebody’) and intricate, sonorous instrumentals (‘At The Mercy of the Elements’), the ep was a full-to-bursting showcase of the duo’s vital, dexterous sound. ‘Thoroughly excellent,’ raved The Australian. ‘Packed with anxiety and bravado,’ Beat said.\n \nWith a growing national profile, Big Scary embarked on a period of heavy touring, with a diverse list of supports that reflected the duo’s eclectic output: The Vasco Era, Florence and the Machine, Midlake, Little Red, Editors. Soon enough the duo began headlining their own shows, first in their hometown of Melbourne and then all over the country.\n \nBig Scary remain endlessly fascinated by the natural world. In 2010, the duo released four seasonally themed, limited-edition eps, which were eventually collected as The Big Scary Four Seasons. A rich, thrillingly diverse set of songs, The Four Seasons showcased Iansek and Syme’s uncanny ability to translate the vagaries and glories of the elements into utterly compelling music.\n \n‘Four Seasons proves to be the defining turning point for Big Scary, for they are no longer the next best thing in Australian music, they are the best thing,' Beat Magazine said of the lp, while the AU Review hailed ‘the versatility and obscene… talent of the players.’\nA national tour followed, with the band playing to packed houses all over the country. Several months later, as the band began to ready their new album, ‘Autumn’, one of the standout tracks from the Four Seasons, was placed in a high-profile AT&amp;T ad in the US, introducing the band to American audiences for the first time.\n \nThe vision for the new record came together on a small island farm, where Iansek and Syme holed up for several weeks after a run of successful summer festival shows, writing and demoing songs. ‘We knew we had a lot of songs that we liked, but they were all so far from each other on the genre scale—super bratty garage, really poppy piano stuff, epic guitar songs, folky acoustic stuff,’ Syme says. ‘The album will still have elements of all that, but we've got some really strong tracks that we think tie it all together.’",

His debut album 'Cosmosphere' was released in 2003 (Volta Records), followed by 2004's 'The Monkeys In The Zoo Have More Fun Than Me' (Trust Me I'm A Thief). Having recently signed with V2 Records (9th May 2007), a third effort 'Ritual' came out on the 4th June 2008. The single 'Phil Lynott' was pushed forward as a possible Christmas number one in Ireland but barely dent the charts, despite being a huge live favourite. His debut at the SXSW festival in Texas (2007) added much hype and excitement to the future prospects of Jape's career. In December 2008 Jape wrote a song with David Kitt for a Christmas compilation called 'An Indiecater Christmas' which was put out by Indiecater Records. 'Ritual' recently won the 2008 Choice Music Award. Read more on Last.fm. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply",

For several years, David travelled throughout Texas and France recording quietly in small rooms, where his formal training began to give way to four-track experimentation, juxtaposing the phase pieces and improvisation of his academic life with lo-fi acoustic compositions. This itinerant approach to recording produced his first two albums ('The Mayflower' 2000; 'Out From Under Ligne 4', 2001) , which employ the use of whatever (non)instruments were at hand, such as dropped coins and pencil scratches in place of drum kits, or lyrics composed by rearranging the contents of the daily newspaper.",

        "summary": "The Antlers are an indie rock band currently based in Brooklyn, New York, fronted by Peter Silberman. Initially, The Antlers was a solo project created by vocalist and guitarist Silberman immediately after he had moved to Brooklyn, New York, in 2007. Silberman wrote the first two albums, \"Uprooted\" and \"In the Attic of the Universe\" by himself and under his own name. Afterwards, he recruited Lerner and Cicci, becoming a collaborative group. The band recorded two EPs: \"Cold War\" and \"New York Hospitals\". Silberman's collection of songs (which was mentioned as an \"elegy for his planned disappearance\") would later become a full-length album titled \"Hospice\" and would feature an epic storyline, telling the story of an abusive relationship through an allegory of a hospice worker losing a patient—for whom he developed feelings for—to bone cancer. Silberman has stated that the album is mostly auto-biographical. The album was independently released by the band in March of 2009, selling an apparently overwhelming number of copies, later selling all of their stock and had to produce more. The band later commented that they had \"bit off more than they could chew\". The album received critical praise for both its narrative and musicianship and has since been listed on several \"Album of the Year\" lists. The band later signed with New York-based French Kiss Records. The label released a remastered \"Hospice\" on August 18, 2009. In 2011, they released \"Burst Apart,\" their follow-up to \"Hospice.\" The album was received with critical acclaim equal to its predecessor, and the band subsequently launched a world tour in support of the record.\nThey released the (together) EP shortly after Burst Apart which contained 8 remixes and covers with several collaberating artists.\nIn 2012 the Undersea EP was released containing 4 new songs. \nOn March 31th 2014 the band announced the 5th studio album called \"Familiars\". It was released on June 17th 2014 receiving critical acclaim worldwide.",

        "summary": "Chicago punk rockers, circus act, and marching band Mucca Pazza formed on a principle that many musicians shun out of hand: band geeks are awesome. In fact, much of Mucca Pazza's appeal comes from their wholehearted acceptance -- even celebration -- of the band nerd identity. The 30-piece group includes standard marching band fare like saxophones, sousaphone, trumpets, trombones, and drums in addition to less common elements like accordion, guitar, violin, and designated cheerleaders. Taking to the stage in intentionally mismatched thrift-store band uniforms, Mucca Pazza perform repertoire including rearranged rock tunes, traditional Czech folk songs, original compositions, and other strange bedfellows too numerous to name. Band director Mark Messing first invited instrumentalist friends to meet up in Chicago's industrial district to play, hoping to create a \"marching band culture nostalgia group.\" More and more musicians continued to arrive for auditions, until the band had swollen to its current epic size. Building up interest and curiosity through word of mouth alone, Mucca Pazza began performing in local bars and clubs. Though it took some time, concert attendees eventually started to outnumber musicians. Performance venues themselves began to compete with the band for oddness, and have included public parks, the stage of Late Night with Conan O'Brien, and canoes floating down the Chicago River. In 2007 Mucca Pazza filled a bus and took to the road for their first-ever tour, following the recording of their debut EP, the 30-minute A Little Marching Band. Plans were in the works for more touring and a full-length album to be released in 2008.",
